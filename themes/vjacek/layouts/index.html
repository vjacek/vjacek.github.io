  <p>Hi, I'm Victor.</p>
  <p>
    At work, I'm a Staff Software Engineer and have deep experience designing,
    building, and leading teams on web-based projects. My work spans from
    empowering monitoring agents to provide 24/7 outdoor security, to building
    an all-new point of sale system with intelligent recommendations, and from
    running an internal experimentation platform toolset to solving energy
    demand queueing.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the deliverables differ, the common thread is that everyone needs
    software, and being part of a team that is able to design and execute
    excellent software is both a huge competitive advantage in the marketplace,
    and more importantly can help make a lot of people's lives better.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a> with a
    Bachelor's degree in
    <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Computer Science</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Outside of work, I still love building things:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://1headline.com">1headline</a> Take control of your media
    consumption with The Newsstand Theory: All the news you really need is
    available by walking past a newsstand and glancing at the front pages. No
    infinite scroll and intentionally minimal; stop wasting your time on sites
    where you're only an
    <span style="font-family: Courier">advertising_id</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My <a href="http://victorjacekphotography.com">Photography</a> work spans a
    wide range with origins in landscape and architecture, and now creating
    dynamic portraints in dance and cheer.
