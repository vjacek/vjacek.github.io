  <p>Hi, I'm Victor.</p>
  <p>
    I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at SimpliSafe where I lead
    development of the web-based tools that monitoring agents use to provide
    24/7 home and outdoor security.
  </p>
  <p>
    At GameStop, I was part of the Core Platform team that designed and built
    many systems: an all-new point-of-sale with intelligent recommendations, a
    distributed warehousing system for ship-from-store and same-day-delivery
    fulfillment, centralized customer information system, revamped pro points
    and subscriptions, and Venmo payments for trade-ins.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Wayfair, I built tools for 4000 customer service agents, was promoted,
    then promoted myself by moving to a new team as the Tech Lead for the
    Experimentation Platform. And prior to Wayfair I worked at a really cool but
    really small startup in the energy sector solving demand queueing, a
    healthcare analytics company, and a defense company.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the deliverables differ, the common thread is that everyone needs
    software, and being part of a team that is able to design and execute
    excellent software is both a huge competitive advantage in the marketplace,
    and more importantly can help make a lot of people's lives better.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">UMASS Amherst</a> with a
    Bachelor's degree in
    <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Computer Science</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Outside of work, I still love building things:</p>

    consumption with The Newsstand Theory: All the news you really need is
    available by walking past a newsstand and glancing at the front pages. No
