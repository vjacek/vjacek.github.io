DID NOT FINISH, RECYCLED
This book successfully tricked me into trying it by using the word &amp;ldquo;Spy&amp;rdquo; in the title, but thouroughly failed at being readable shortly thereafter. The &amp;ldquo;spy&amp;rdquo; part of the book is glossed over rapidly, the protagonist attending CIA training and becoming an expert in thrilling skills such as firearms, encryption cyphers, and avoiding other agents, all in about 4 pages.</description>

This book&amp;rsquo;s severe simplicity brings the readability down to, in my estimation, around an 8th grade level. The writing is pretty lackluster and boring, but the core messages are actually very solid. It just takes far too many pages to say too little about these ideas.
&amp;ldquo;Holy Moments&amp;rdquo; are first defined as when someone chooses to take a Good action instead of a Bad.</description>

This book is a great fast and fun read, regardless of your familiarity with Brent&amp;rsquo;s Youtube channel about living in Cerro Gordo. If you are already familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look behind the scenes into some of the details and off-camera hard work it has taken to start rebuilding a ghost town.
By far my favorite thing about the book however, is that Brent actually demonstrates what it looks like to live life as a Stoic.</description>

Nobody remembers anything small, so why do we bother? Small changes rarely have the desired impact, because we have compromised before ever starting the project. When we accept that doing &amp;ldquo;just this part&amp;rdquo; will be good enough, we are actively saying that we can indeed see the big picture, but don&amp;rsquo;t believe that either it&amp;rsquo;s possible or worthwhile to accomplish it. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s not worthwhile to accomplish the big-picture ask, should we even be attempting the scaled-down version?</description>

This book suffers from an unfortunate case of being a product of a very specific time and set of circumstances. Moving from waterfall to agile, lunchtime card games, all-staff meetings, and working weekends to &amp;ldquo;ship&amp;rdquo; are all bygones in 2024. Originally written 10 years ago and just now supposedly updated then repackaged, the book does not hold up. Concrete lessons are few and far between, with the most helpful sections focusing on identifying the personalities of different players in the corporate game.</description>

Automating my mistakes While building the initial steps of the GTQ project I found mysef stuck without a way to test code locally (at least without standing up a lot more project environment scaffolding), meaning that I had a slightly longer than ideal change/test loop:</description>

Where I learn about memory profiling in Python We&amp;rsquo;ve observed that Simulations can fail when run in Kubernetes pods. We suspect the reason is that these pods are under-resourced and are running out of memory, then being killed/restarted by Kubernetes in order to keep the overall cluster healthy.</description>

★ ★ ★ ★ ★
One of the most impressive aspects of Asimov&amp;rsquo;s writing is that it can change your worldview in just a few pages of a short story. When the twist at the end makes you rethink how the universe works, the writing comes alive off the page.
The Nightfall anthology is great for 2 reasons. It covers a huge range of topics, styles, and story sizes.</description>

      <description>For the first time, probably ever, I think I actually own all the books I read in the previous year. So while I enjoy ranking books, among other things, doing it physically is a fun twist!
If I had to place a dividing line, I&amp;rsquo;d put only the top 4, The Deep Range and above, into my &amp;ldquo;highly recommended&amp;rdquo; list for the year. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of myself for trying such a wide range of books, but in the future I would rather increse the percentage of books that I really enjoy.</description>

★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆
This book took me probably 6 months to finish. I picked it up several times, but struggled to find it interesting enough to finish and frequently moved on to a new book. I would have greatly preferred to simply read stories about Shetty&amp;rsquo;s time in the ashram, and how he applies those lessons to modern life.
It sits at the intersection of productive self-improvement and philosophy, so ostensibly a very interesting subject.</description>

★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆
This book really sucks. Mostly for the completely wasted opportunities of fairly good ideas. A world too cold for insects and animals larger than a dog to survive, yet with still active volcanic zones. People who are both genders. Explorers from worlds light years away making contact with primitive humans and bringing them into a universal community. Actually, that last one had a documentary about it called Stargate.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to start listening to any book that opens with &amp;ldquo;You might not want to read this book.&amp;rdquo; The problem is that I really did want to read this book, or at least the story that I thought it would be great if it contained. I wanted to read about how Auri came to be who she is and live where she does, and why her view of the world is shaped the way it is.</description>

As I read Fantasy and Sci-Fi books, I like to take note of particular writing methods and distill them into themes that can be harnessed when doing my own writing. These themes of course can be split into &amp;ldquo;emulate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;avoid&amp;rdquo;. The Wise Man&amp;rsquo;s Fear is gracious enough to provide one of each.
In-Universe Complex Context Reload
Starting off with the &amp;ldquo;emulate&amp;rdquo; column, as a sequal, this book is responsible for bringing you back into Kvothe&amp;rsquo;s world of the Four Corners.</description>

At almost 700 pages, this is far from the longest book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read, but I read it faster than some books 1/3 it&amp;rsquo;s size. Perhaps an even greater compliment is the several times I stayed up hours late reading to finish the story.
The story itself is actually nothing all that earth-shattering: our hero is orphaned as a young boy, learns hard lessons on the street, finds himself clever enough to make it to the magical University, and then excells in lessons, while causing a fair amount of trouble.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the antagonist of a book before, but it turns out to be pretty fun. When a logical argument can be made for the representatives of both Heaven and Hell to work together because the real problem is those pesky humans, the result is a golden story. The best part is that the relationship between an angel and demon turns out incredibly naturally, perhaps because they both borrow so much of their personalities from those same flawed humans.</description>

Reading this book strongly reinforces the importance of approaching a series in order, and ideally without interruption. In this case, I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and the experience suffered for it. I had read the first book in the series, unknowingly skipped the second two, and picked up this book as the 4th because I knew I enjoyed the author and series. The problem is that significant plot points and items are discussed as if they are common knowledge, because to the characters they are, but I had to piece them together with very limited context clues.</description>

This book is a fun, quick, and entertaining read, but the best part is that it&amp;rsquo;s a techno-thriller that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get anything wrong. Although this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the accomplishment that it is, not getting any technical details wrong really is quite notable. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly complaining that an author decided to include detail they didn&amp;rsquo;t need to, and then got some part of that detail wrong.</description>

That makes it all the more fun to find situations that can be improved. Our most recent trip in August 2023 provided a few:

I can&amp;rsquo;t really figure out why this book was 600 pages long. There&amp;rsquo;s not a huge amount of action, intrigue, and certainly not suspense. Oh, except that GRRM blurbed the cover and the proles think he&amp;rsquo;s the only fiction author to ever exist, despite ample evidence that he&amp;rsquo;s both a terrible and lazy writer.
Characters and places are described directly, but in the wrong sort of way.</description>

      <description>Why do we like overpacking for trips so much?
I think it&amp;rsquo;s because the brain loves resets and new things - I think the brain actually loves getting good at new skills and environments much more than it enjoys being good at those same skills and in those same environments. The brain is near infinitely flexible and that&amp;rsquo;s its ultimate strength.
I just finished packing for a single weekend away. I wanted to bring a journal and necessary fountain pen, writing prompt book, a new nonfiction book to read, handheld amateur radio, laptop, camera gear, and Nintendo Switch.</description>

I somehow made it through the 90s without ever seeing Jurassic Park the movie, so when I found a paperback copy of Jurassic Park the book at the Northborough Library Book Sale, I figured this was my opportunity to do it the right way.

Some subjects are always worth learning about, even if they&amp;rsquo;re not personally interesting, generally interesting, or have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. These subjects demand at least some attention from any learned mind, even if the only lessons are in their awfulness, responsibility, or consequences. A few books about the Holocaust come to mind, especially Night by Eli Wiesel. There is nothing good about the subject, but learning and understanding it teaches the reader about an awful part of the world so that we may understand and avoid it.</description>

This book is classic Sci-Fi at it&amp;rsquo;s best - a plucky protagonist with a few more smarts and skills than average takes on a new mission, a mission that he succeeds at in fact, until the pivotal brain-bending twist that forces you to step back and think &amp;ldquo;What If?&amp;rdquo;.

I think I read this book incorrectly. I approached it in the usual manner; starting at the front, making progress one page at a time, until all pages have been turned in order. Progress was measured in groups of 10-20 pages, covering the stories of 2-5 individual colors at a time.
There are other valid methods however, and it seems a wise reminder to not automatically approach every scenario with only the exact techniques that have worked in the past.</description>

      <description>In a quote that I can neither exactly remember nor find [1], in which some terribly heretical 19th-century socialist extolls the absurdity of limiting a work day to 8 hours, they also comment on the remaining 8 hours of leisure, rest, and relaxation time that each man has available at the end of the workday, and before the biologically required 8 hours of sleep. The main point is that every man is free to conduct himself exactly like the wealthy for those 8 hours.</description>

The Serpentwar Saga is off to an unfortunate start: we follow a mercenary company as they sail around for a bit, march here, march over there, march up those mountains, march back down the slightly easier other side of the mountain, march into a town, march out of a town, march into a meeting of companies, march away from the other companies, march through a strange magical tunnel that turns out to have absolutely no bearing on the story&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s a huge amount of adventuring around in order to learn the super secret important information, but when the mission is completed, we&amp;rsquo;re not even included on what the secret info was.</description>

      <description>Prince of the Blood Raymond E. Feist
★ ★ ★ ★ ★
You could equally hand this book to a new reader of high fantasy or to a longtime fan of the genre and the Riftwar, and they would both be impressed and excited throughout the length of the story. Focusing on Prince Arutha&amp;rsquo;s sons journey to Kesh and their own maturity, Jimmy the Hand takes a significant supporting role as mentor and conspirator of Arutha&amp;rsquo;s stunning last-page twist.</description>

      <description>As I sit down to write this, logging into Goodreads with a Facebook account hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked for 12 days. That seems like a fairly insane timeframe for an outage of this magnitude. But it also shows something else important. Amazon doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about Goodreads. Although that&amp;rsquo;s probably been obvious to the site&amp;rsquo;s users for some time, this puts a number on how low the priority stack ranking goes. After all, what percetage of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s business is books anymore?</description>

      <description>I recently spent some time thinking about how nice it is to be able to pay for gas a with a phone app from inside the car, the get out and start pumping immediately, no card swiping or buttons besides the big 89 needed. And once you&amp;rsquo;re done pumping, the app collects one single point of feeback data: you can click either the Smile, Meh, or Frown emoji.
Theoretically, something is being done with this data.</description>

      <title>Design Inspiration from a Gas Station</title>

      <description>In the past few years, Cumberland Farms has transformed themselves from a blue-and-orange gas station that you go to because you have to, into a blue-and-green (because you can reap the marketing rewards of the color green) gas station destination.
They did all this by changing the few things that people actually care about when it comes to gas stations. The stations now have a bright, modern design, with white walls and light wood floors.</description>
