  <h1>Something Exciting</h1>
  <time datetime=2024-05-06T22:24:21-0400 class="post-date">Mon, May 6, 2024</time>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a huge amount of SciFi recently, and wanted to try writing my own original story with a brand new idea, with an Asimov-style twist at the end. Enjoy -</p>
<h5 id="something-exciting">Something Exciting</h5>
<p>Joe opened his lunchbox and let the metal lid clink down on the workbench. Peanut butter and jelly, again. Certainly better than he had eaten during much of his time at the university, but not quite as exciting as he might wish for. Just like the job itself, he supposed.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with the job, really. They paid him enough to cover all the mandatory subscriptions, and even a few optional ones. He got to work indoors, where the air was both cooled and filtered. That was mostly for the scientific equipment, but still those luxuries made Joe&rsquo;s night a little nicer.</p>
<p>After achieving all of the required degrees, Joe had taken one of the only jobs where they still hired people like him. The observatory wasn&rsquo;t glamorous, but Joe figured it was better than mining coins or clicks. Much better still than having to beg for art from the AIs so that he could flip it to collectors and prospectors.</p>
<p>While the insulated roof made things comfortable, the interesting part of Joe’s night was trying out new ideas out once in a while; that&rsquo;s why they still hired an astronomer after all. The robots handled all the operational work, rotating and elevating the observatory for different views of the night sky, manipulating the heavy interchangeable camera sensors, and archiving data stacks. But they still couldn&rsquo;t really imagine the same wild guesses an astronomer could. Scan the sky in a nice grid, sure, easy way to cover a lot of area. Took forever though. But if you wanted to hypothesize that there might be some nice asteroids getting pulled out of the belt by the mass of all the stations hanging out at different Lagrange points nowadays, they weren&rsquo;t exactly thinking up that task from scratch. Unless something tripped a sensor’s tolerances, the robots were content to think nothing had changed. Night after night Joe came to work and sat with the instruments. Looking for the smallest irregularity or hint, enhancing the signal, and finally delivering coordinates to the miners. They would go and do the actual retrieval of the asteroid of course, but without him, sky scans would be forced to cover much more area, gathering data then analyzing it, blindly guessing and checking where things might be.</p>
<p>“What are we looking for, gentlemen? Let’s see the list.” The viewscreen silently refreshed and showed the top mining priorities of the moment. Water, first as usual, cobalt, copper, and a dozen other metals which no longer remained in Earth’s crust glowed a soft green in the observatory’s darkness.</p>
<p>Joe took a bite of the peanut butter and jelly, and flipped a few switches to start up the telescope. He heard cryofluid divert from the air conditioning loop and start flowing around the scope&rsquo;s collector. It had been refitted with an ultra-wideband receiver capable of listening on infrared, micro, and radio waves. With these improvements, Joe could hear the signature of just about anything in the system.</p>
<p>Earth had been listening for a few centuries now, and had made some useful discoveries: both asteroids that could be mined for precious metals, and gamma bursts that they had needed to shield themselves from. They would pull in asteroids of simple iron and silicas most days just to make sure there was enough to go around. They were able to find everything needed to feed the industry that dominated the planet&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll get lucky and hit an iceberg tonight, huh?&rdquo; Joe said. The robots responded with silent blinks of their status lights, which was what they always did, whether or not Joe was talking to them. &ldquo;You know if I find some water that&rsquo;s worth double what cobalt is these days.&rdquo; Joe couldn&rsquo;t afford to drink that kind of unused water himself, but figured he&rsquo;d never know better anyway.</p>
<p>Listening for asteroids was always profitable for the observatory&rsquo;s owners, but it struggled to hold Joe&rsquo;s interest. When Joe was little he had thought it would be nifty to make first contact with another planet, maybe meet another blip of life out there across the emptiness of space. He could tell them so much about Earth: all the great factories underneath and the city on top, all the robots that helped him every day. So every once in a while, usually as a little reward to himself after finding some ice, Joe would take the scope off its normal bands for an hour or so and look for patterns. Patterns meant an interruption of the cosmic background noise with even just a little bit of signal created by someone else out there. All he would need to find would be a stream of data that didn&rsquo;t start inside the system. Maybe one day he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello out there,&rdquo; Joe muttered around another mouthful of peanut butter and jelly. The telescope couldn&rsquo;t transmit his voice to anyone outside the building, but as he flipped the last switch, the observatory with its high curved ceiling started echoing with static. Joe had connected the radio receiver to the observatory&rsquo;s internal speakers so that he could listen directly to the same signal that the computers were listening to. Those computers analyzed for data signals a million ways every second, yet it was just calm static to his non-silicon ears. Despite the emptiness of the dark observatory, it made him feel connected to whatever was out there, all the suns keeping their little planets warm, nestled into cozy nebulas. Every once in a while Joe would be able to hear a pulsar&rsquo;s great whoosh filling the air as its radiation ripped across the surface of Earth.</p>
<p>Tonight was quiet though, the flat blur of static making it clear that Earth was as alone in the system as Joe was in the observatory.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another key rotation, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John took the data stack from the ship&rsquo;s commander and networked it to the computer terminal in front of him. The ship&rsquo;s display wall glowed green once around the edges as it updated the encryption keys, then went back to showing the void blackness of space, peppered with a few labels for interests in the current system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day now, since we&rsquo;re operating within a primitive solar system. The folks here still think they&rsquo;re alone, so they don&rsquo;t know any better than to pollute the whole spectrum with their waves. Our signals need to stay encrypted so they can&rsquo;t tell us apart from the background noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem boss, no Prime Directive violations on my shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Joe crumpled the peanut butter and jelly&rsquo;s plastifoil wrapper and tossed it into the atomizer compartment of his lunchbox. He closed the box with a clink and latched it with a double clack, swiftly pushing it to the side as his powerchair reclined. Joe closed his eyes to listen to the static.</p>
<p>Tomorrow he&rsquo;d make a fluffernutter for lunch. Now that would be something exciting.</p>
