  <h1>Design Inspiration from a Gas Station</h1>
  <time datetime=2018-02-25T01:02:03-0405 class="post-date">Sun, Feb 25, 2018</time>
  <p>In the past few years, Cumberland Farms has transformed themselves from a blue-and-orange gas station that you go to because you have to, into a blue-and-green (because you can reap the marketing rewards of <em>the color green</em>) gas station destination.</p>

<p>They did all this by changing the few things that people actually care about when it comes to gas stations.  The stations now have a bright, modern design, with white walls and light wood floors.  Their shelves are consistently well stocked, and they are even <em>clean</em>.</p>

<p>However, since we&rsquo;re engineers here, nobody cares about any of that nonsense because it&rsquo;s not immediately <strong>useful</strong>.</p>

<p>What is useful is their mobile app, which gives you a 10 cent discount on every gallon of gas.  Even more importantly, it prevents you from having to press some garbage-level tactile buttons and swipe a physical card like a neanderthal just asking for their card to get skimmed.  Using a mobile app from the insulated comfort of your own vehicle is clearly a superior experience.</p>

<p>Cumby&rsquo;s latest update includes an interesting new feature that everybody everywhere should be learning from and then utilizing.  As soon as the app detects that you&rsquo;re done pumping gas, it shows you the grand total, and the bottom half of the screen is taken up by a simple question - &ldquo;How&rsquo;d we do?&rdquo; and 3 emojis: Smile, Meh, and Frown.</p>

<p>This is the entirety of the user feedback process.  One click.  No comparisons, no stars, and most of all <em>no text input</em>.</p>

<p>Smile, Meh, Frown.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that Nobody Cares!  Nobody cares enough about pumping gas to give you thoughtful feedback and constructive criticism over it.  Three emojis is about the full extend of the average gas station patron&rsquo;s available attention.  You&rsquo;re lucky if people care enough about the 10-cent savings to come to this station in the first place.  In a world dominated by television shows comprised entirely of 2-second jump cuts, user attention, critical thinking, and meaningful feedback and is at an all time low.  Your app should consider itself <em>incredibly</em> lucky to get one single extra click of a user&rsquo;s infinitely fractured attention, and be grateful for it.</p>

<p>One more thought to ponder - One emoji worth of data isn&rsquo;t much, so what exactly is Cumberland Farms doing with it?</p>
