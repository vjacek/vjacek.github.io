<p>First, the negatives, because there are few. The writing in this book is dry and academic, with the structure making it feel like you&rsquo;re reading a series of 5-paragraph-essays from elementary school It tells instead of showing, and that slows the cadence of interest.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the message is both incredibly effective and simple:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Do fewer things.

Work at a natural pace.

Obsess over quality.
</code></pre><p>While those rules along could be enough, the bulk of the book is a pleasent discussion on the historical framework, where we went wrong, and how to fix it. I do wish there were more, or deeper, real-world examples.</p>
<p>For some of the suggested improvemenets, it feels like I&rsquo;ve skipped to about 50% complete, simply by being a software engineer at a modern company. The idea of having to implement my own work queue because I have a boss who hovers and throws self-interrupting tasks my direction is thankfully totally foreign. This is absolutely a good thing, even if it comes at the expense of knowing more details than the book contains, because seeing those thoughts reinforced by an outside party (who studies these issues for a living) is incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>I also happened to read this book at the absolute best time - right after starting a new job. I&rsquo;ve already said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a few things, skipped an irrelevant meeting, and focused on the tasks that have the highest impact. One of the best highlights of the book is the point that only a few tasks are going to be ones that actually matter. There are tons of tasks that you &ldquo;should&rdquo; do, but are not rewarded and only cause a personal negative. In my case, I identified a set of tickets that needed to be written and put into JIRA. While I&rsquo;m certainly capable of doing that, I realized that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a task that is rewarded, so I let the PM do it and instead focused on some code that would both matter as a feature deliverable and buy me some career capital.</p>
<p>For another example, I needed a rather large and complexly formatted page migrated from Notion to Confluence. Because neither of these tools can manage to work with interoperable markdown standards, this meant hand-formatting nearly every line. Instead of doing that, I asked another PM if she know how to do this easily. She didn&rsquo;t, but then <em>volunteered to do it for me</em>. And once it was done, she was happy to have saved me the time, actually saying that I had better things to do. This was both mind-blowing and paradigm shifting; I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for both the help, and more importantly the lesson. I can be the one to ask tasks of others. At least sometimes.</p>
<p>I put a 5 hour meeting on Friday afternoons labelled &ldquo;Deep Work&rdquo; to prevent scheduled interruptions of my focused work time. If somebody actually needs me, the issue will be so important that I&rsquo;ll get pinged enough on slack to warrant the interruption. More likely, I&rsquo;m going to put more &ldquo;Deep Work&rdquo; blocks on Monday and Wednesday afternoons too. If I&rsquo;m delivering exceptional work, people will be more than willing to accept some late replies or non-participation. I&rsquo;m intentionally leveraging people&rsquo;s politeness and reluctance to be a Friday-afternoon-bother to further my own goals.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m writing this I&rsquo;m starting to see some kind of overlap with Kevin Mitnick&rsquo;s social engineering in <em>The Art of Deception</em>&hellip; (1) That&rsquo;s probably worth exploring&hellip;</p>
<p>One addition I would make is taking some advice a step further. While you might ordinarily want to force tasks through a single-threaded queue, you still have the ability to be smart about how you apply this. Should a high-impact task show up, it can be beneficial for your career to allow it to skip the process that usually does a good job of slowing tasks down. Sorting everything by priority is very powerful.</p>
<p>(1) <em>The Art of Deception</em> was the first life-changing book I read. For my purely analytical mind, it was my introduction to psychology; the fact that the intent and motivation of others could be something besides the stated, and that leveraging the difference could be done for personal gain.</p>
