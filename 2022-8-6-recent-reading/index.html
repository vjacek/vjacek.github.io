  <p>As I sit down to write this, logging into Goodreads with a Facebook account hasn&rsquo;t worked for 12 days. That seems like a fairly insane timeframe for an outage of this magnitude. But it also shows something else important. Amazon doesn&rsquo;t care about Goodreads. Although that&rsquo;s probably been obvious to the site&rsquo;s users for some time, this puts a number on how low the priority stack ranking goes. After all, what percetage of Amazon&rsquo;s business is books anymore?</p>
<p>The problem is that I <em>do</em> care about reading, so if Amazon doesn&rsquo;t care about Goodreads, then neither care about me. Which is true, book readers are no significant source of revenue for them. This does however provide the inspiration for a long-desired activity, writing. Finding new books to read is easy, so I don&rsquo;t need any pretend-AI/ML suggestions, I&rsquo;ll own my own data, and it&rsquo;s certainly a double-edged sword, but nobody but my own effort can stop supporting this platform.</p>
<p>Most of the mental re-hydration required to set up a blog is easy. The steps required are themselves few and simple, and I&rsquo;ve even left myself good notes. But the perennial problem of owning your own entire tech stack quickly arises&hellip;</p>
<p><em>If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.</em><br>
<em>- Carl Sagan</em></p>
<h3 id="dune-messiah">Dune Messiah</h3>
<p>Frank Herbert<br>
★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Nothing really happens in this entire book. Paul Maud&rsquo;Dib antagonizes himself with the ability to see the future, yet somehow do nothing about his own predestination. Instead of a storyline, the book skips around to follow the fleeting thoughts of several characters and their current feelings towards one another; the definition of a Space Opera, in the worst way. The conflict is stated instead of shown, and the fascinating future-historic technology of <em>Dune</em> is almost entirely missing. Existing in the same universe as the excellent <em>Dune</em> entirely fails to be a redeeming quality of this sequel.</p>
<h3 id="the-peripheral">The Peripheral</h3>
<p>William Gibson<br>
★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>The protagonist of this book is a bystander to the story, and to a minor character&rsquo;s conflict. She does nothing to advance the story, and barely participates in it. This is either one of the greatest examples of &ldquo;being nothing but a pawn in a game for higher beings&rdquo;, or a very disjointed way of telling a story; I&rsquo;m very much not sure which is true. The dystopian futurism feels at times ominously achievable, and at others, narrowly focused on insignificant themes. The last two chapters feel tacked on in order to berate the reader with two of the extrordinarily few salient and moral points. The ending where everything works out perfectly is supremely boring, and doesn&rsquo;t match the dystopian setting of the rest of the story.</p>
<h3 id="jimmy-the-hand">Jimmy the Hand</h3>
<p>Raymond E. Feist<br>
★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Jimmy&rsquo;s signature cleverness is used to great effect both causing and getting out of trouble in a series of adventures, where the reader gets to know more inner workings of the Thieves Guild. A parallel storyline details events touched upon in the main Riftwar Saga. This is the main drawback of the book; Jimmy&rsquo;s adventures are second to none, yet half the book is spent following others.</p>
<h3 id="an-astronauts-guide-to-life-on-earth">An Astronaut&rsquo;s Guide to Life on Earth</h3>
<p>Chris Hadfield<br>
★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>When I read nonfiction, instead of taking notes in the moment, I take a picture of the salient passage and transcribe them later. The stories Commander Hadfield shares are incredibly interesting and well told, but the sheer number of pithy lessons that I found myself returning to undoubtedly rank this book very highly.</p>
<p>On Preparation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, fear comes from not knowing what to expect and not feeling you have any control over what&rsquo;s about to happen. When you feel helpless, you&rsquo;re far more afraid than you would be if you knew the facts. If you&rsquo;re not sure what to be alarmed about, everything is alarming.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Preparation is not ony about managing external risks, but about limiting the liklihood that you&rsquo;ll unwittingly add to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anticipating problems and figuring out how to solve them is actually the opposite of worrying: it&rsquo;s productive. Likewise, coming up with a plan of action isn&rsquo;t a waste of time if it gives you peace of mind. While it&rsquo;s true that you may wind up being ready for something that never happens, if the stakes are at all high, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people talk about expecting the best but preparing for the worst, but I think that&rsquo;s a seductively misleading concept. There&rsquo;s never just one &ldquo;worst&rdquo;. Almost always there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum of bad possibilities. The only thing that would really qualify as <em>the</em> worst would be not having a plan for how to cope.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a sim is a proving ground where you demonstrate how well rounded your capabilities are, but more often, it&rsquo;s a crucible where you identify gaps in your knowledge and encouter domino effects that simply never occured to you before.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; take your simulation seriously and engage as fully as you would in real life - but be prepared that the sim itself may be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Forward planning was an easy way to show the people who made it possible for me to do my job that I didn&rsquo;t take them for granted. Making a flowery toast afterward, thanking your nearest and dearest for all their support, just won&rsquo;t cut it if, again and again, you&rsquo;ve passed up opportunities to show appreciation in real time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humility and Relationships:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you start thinking that only your biggest and shiniest moments count, you&rsquo;re setting yourself up to feel like a failure most of the time. Personally, I&rsquo;d rather feel good most of the time, so to me everything counts: the small moments, the medium ones, the successes that make the papers and also the ones that no one knows about but me. The challenge is avoiding being derailed by the big, shiny moments that turn other people&rsquo;s heads. You have to figure out for yourself how to enjoy and celebrate them, and then move on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was also a big part of what made him a plus one on our crew. Not only did he bring a wealth of experience and knowledge, but he conducted himself as though no task was beneath him. He acted as though he considered himself a zero: reasonably competent but no better than anybody else. That made a lasting impression on me. Especially when I&rsquo;m entering a new situation and don&rsquo;t yet have the lay of the land, I think about how to aim to be a zero and try to contribute in small ways without creating disruptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My point though, is that saying thank you every once in a while just isn&rsquo;t enough when you&rsquo;re demanding that other people make real sacrifices so you can pursue your goals. It&rsquo;s not only the fun showy things like vacations that get the message across. You also have to be willing to do what you can to create the conditions that allow your partner the freedom to focus single-mindedly at times.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="coraline">Coraline</h3>
<p>Neil Gaiman<br>
★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>This book is <em>weird</em>, in the great way that Neil Gaiman excells at. Thouroughly enjoyable, I read this over the course of two afternoons. Some years ago, I spent days reading <em>American Gods</em> - and although they are both weird in a similar and excellent sort of way, <em>Coraline</em> was a much faster, simpler, experince, and refreshing for it. Elements of the simplicity and directness that quickly advance the story are strong positive influences that I&rsquo;ll use for myself in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something that you cannot see.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;Now, <em>you</em> people have names. That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know who you are. We know who we are, so we don&rsquo;t need names.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Coraline sighed. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t understand, do you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted? Just like that, and it didn&rsquo;t <em>mean</em> anything. What then?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And he said that wasn&rsquo;t brave of him, doing that, just standing there and being stung,&rdquo; Coraline said to the cat. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t brave because he wasn&rsquo;t scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. <em>That</em> was brave.
&hellip;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re scared but you still do it anyway, <em>that&rsquo;s</em> brave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="digital-minimalism">Digital Minimalism</h3>
<p>Cal Newport<br>
★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>This book builds on the consistent themes of Professor Newport&rsquo;s work - that in our new attention economy, your time is your most precious resource, and protecting it from digital distractions is exceedingly and increasingly difficult, because millions of the smartest mind-hours are devoted to depriving you of it for their own profit.</p>
<p>In defense of this onslaught, high-quality leisure undertaken solely for the satisifaction of it&rsquo;s completion provides a significant mental fortress. Solitude and itentional practice of using digital tools for a singular purpose further remove the mind from increasingly assumed-standard distractions.</p>
<p>Although repetative in the message at times, and feeling like it could easily be condensed into a few blog posts, the book is an enjoyable read - all the more so because reading the long version is itself a form of digital minimalism. I could feel myself attempt escape to the familarness of my phone while reading sections I deemed repetative, but the very first lesson is therefore self-contained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the void is filled, you no longer need distractions to help you avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your life consists only of actions whose &ldquo;worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re vulnerable to the existential despair that blooms in response to the inevitable question, <em>Is this all there is to life?</em></p>
</blockquote>
