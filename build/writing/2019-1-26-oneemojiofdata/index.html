  <p>I recently spent some time thinking about how nice it is to be able to pay for gas a with a phone app from inside the car, the get out and start pumping immediately, no card swiping or buttons besides the big 89 needed.  And once you&rsquo;re done pumping, the app collects one single point of feeback data: you can click either the Smile, Meh, or Frown emoji.</p>
<p>Theoretically, something is being done with this data.  And hopefully, it&rsquo;s useful analysis that is eventually incorporated into improvements and higher returns for the business.  On the surface, one emoji worth of data isn&rsquo;t that much and it might be pretty tough to understand anything about user experience with one solitary data point.</p>
<p>The great news is, we have Computers.  We have Powerful Computers and they are Everywhere.  And these ever-present Powerful Computers are incredibly good at doing extremely small, extremely repetitive tasks extremely quickly.  These Computers can be set up to measure each and every interaction that the distracted driver just had with their app, and the integrated total environmental circumstance that dominated their interaction.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s price per gallon of gas.</p>
<p>Location.</p>
<p>Outside temperature.</p>
<p>Time spent signing into the app binned by face, fingerprint, and passcode options.</p>
<p>Network latency to turn the pump on.</p>
<p>Time between enabling the pump and start of dispensing.</p>
<p>Gyroscope-measured motion sensing tracking users getting in and out of their car.</p>
<p>Number of times the screen is locked and unlocked.</p>
<p>Duration the phone goes back in a users pocket based on light and proximity sensors.</p>
<p>GPS-measured speed of the user leaving the station before they can be bothered to even close the app or when clicking one single emoji is still asking too much.</p>
<p>Are there any other events currently happening at the station?  Gas truck filling tanks and blocking driveways?  Power out inside?  Out of milk inside?  Lottery machines broken?</p>
<p>None of these data points are terribly significant on their own, but if the user experience is measured to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There was a tanker truck filling the station pouring diesel fumes in my face so I got in the car but it wasn&rsquo;t running and air conditioned so I was hot and angry and threw my phone on the seat because I still needed to get milk and they only had 2% left so my whole day is ruined&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; customers simply end up with negative associations to the station, <del>even if they themselves don&rsquo;t know why</del>.</p>
<p>The harsh reality for businesses is that consumers are so used to being <strong>catered to on silver platter and bended knee</strong>, that to attract their dollars most businesses must continue to do the same.</p>
<p>Now think about the beautifully useful data that could be synthesized by capturing all of these metrics for the entire duration of the user&rsquo;s interaction with the app.  If sign-in takes too long, especially when it&rsquo;s cold outside and late at night, that&rsquo;s a barrier to use and people will use their cards or cash more, costing the station higher processing fees or cashier time.  If their car&rsquo;s bluetooth self-diagnosis reported low tire pressure, advertise that green stop-leak slime and make another sale.  If the app&rsquo;s gyroscopes measure users bouncing up and down while the pump is running, check that they are working at the maximum possible flow rate to prevent users from talking about &ldquo;that station with the pumps that are soooo slow&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The data is there.  It&rsquo;s free and users are <em>already</em> creating tons of it.  It&rsquo;s the <strong>synthesis</strong> of data that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Go get it.</p>
<p>And then put it to work.</p>
