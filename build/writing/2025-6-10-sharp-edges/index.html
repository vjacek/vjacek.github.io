  <p>I think the sharp edges in life are actually the best parts. Sharp edges pull our interest, hold our thoughts, give us excitement, and discriminate between the mundane and the excellent.</p>
<p>Lucy and I just returned from a trip to Disneyland in California. Unlike Disney World in Florida, Disneyland is in the middle of a city (Anaheim, a suburb of Los Angleles and second-best known for the Mighty Ducks). This means that in addition to the park, there&rsquo;s a good number of nearby attractions easily accessible by car. We decided to rent a car for a few days of the trip, and were able to take it to Huntington Beach (AKA Surf City, USA), Newport Beach, the Hollywood walk of Fame (think Times Square, but much dumpier), Disney Studios in Burbank, the Carousel at Griffith Park, and the wonderfully interesting Griffith Observatory. It&rsquo;s view overlooking both the city of LA and the Hollywood Sign make it one of <em>the</em> establishing shots if you&rsquo;ve ever watched a TV show or movie set in LA. And for fans of <em>The Terminator</em>, its where the T-800 first arrives in Sarah Connors&rsquo; timeline.</p>
<p>We saw a lot of interesting places, but the sharp edge here was the car we drove to get there.</p>
<p>A Ford Mustang, convertable.</p>
<p>This car is terrible. It&rsquo;s far too low to the ground, making it incredibly difficult to get in and out, especially if you&rsquo;re in a tight city and can&rsquo;t open the doors all the way. Hit the incline of a parking lot a little too fast and you&rsquo;re scraping the front bumper. Driving with the top down on the freeway is loud, and everything in the back blows around in danger of falling out. Although there&rsquo;s barely room to put anything in the back seats anyways, and a trunk smaller than some backpacks. All for around 20 MPG.</p>
<p>But it had 300 horsepower.</p>
<p>And super wide tires to deliver that power to the pavement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s FAST.</p>
<p>If you mash the pedal, it accelerates hard, no matter if you&rsquo;re at a standstill or already on the highway.</p>
<p>This car is the epitome of a sharp edge in life - a huge number of impracticalities that make it unsuitable for a daily driver or &ldquo;do anything&rdquo; vechicle, but a single overwhelming factor so important that it dominates all rational analysis. Using the Mustang as an example, I think we should try our best to experience the sharp edges in life - objects, places, and ideas with gravity so strong that they are impossible to escape. Then revel in the joy of absolute opinion excellently executed. This opinionated perspective gives the freedom to be a single thing, perfectly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found a few other sharp edges in my life:</p>
<ul>
<li>The opposite of Alton Brown&rsquo;s infamous kitchen unitaskers, workshop tools that perform a single function perfectly are a joy to use.</li>
<li>Programming in general, and the Linux command line. One of the steepest learning curves I&rsquo;ve ever expeerienced, but once it <em>clicks</em>&hellip; It&rsquo;s a pure mental superpower.</li>
<li>A literal pocketknfe. There are an amazing number of scenarios where it&rsquo;s inappropriate to pull out a knife to solve a problem, but an order of magnitude more where it&rsquo;s useful.</li>
<li>Wearing shorts well into October or November. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you cold?&rdquo; Yes, of course I&rsquo;m cold, and it&rsquo;s wonderful to feel the seasons!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely open to dissenting opinions, but only after you launch a Mustang from a stoplight, and then drive it up the California hills to Griffith Observatory.</p>
