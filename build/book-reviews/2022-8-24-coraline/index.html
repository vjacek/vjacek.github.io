  <p>Neil Gaiman</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>This book is <em>weird</em>, in the great way that Neil Gaiman excells at. Thouroughly enjoyable, I read this over the course of two afternoons. Some years ago, I spent days reading <em>American Gods</em> - and although they are both weird in a similar and excellent sort of way, <em>Coraline</em> was a much faster, simpler, experince, and refreshing for it. Elements of the simplicity and directness that quickly advance the story are strong positive influences that I&rsquo;ll use for myself in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something that you cannot see.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;Now, <em>you</em> people have names. That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know who you are. We know who we are, so we don&rsquo;t need names.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Coraline sighed. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t understand, do you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted? Just like that, and it didn&rsquo;t <em>mean</em> anything. What then?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And he said that wasn&rsquo;t brave of him, doing that, just standing there and being stung,&rdquo; Coraline said to the cat. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t brave because he wasn&rsquo;t scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. <em>That</em> was brave.
&hellip;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re scared but you still do it anyway, <em>that&rsquo;s</em> brave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
