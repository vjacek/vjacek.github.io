  <h3 id="the-name-of-the-wind">The Name of the Wind</h3>
<p>Patrick Rothfuss</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>At almost 700 pages, this is far from the longest book I&rsquo;ve ever read, but I read it faster than some books 1/3 it&rsquo;s size. Perhaps an even greater compliment is the several times I stayed up hours late reading to finish the story.</p>
<p>The story itself is actually nothing all that earth-shattering: our hero is orphaned as a young boy, learns hard lessons on the street, finds himself clever enough to make it to the magical University, and then excells in lessons, while causing a fair amount of trouble. The story strikes me as a more logical and fully-developed version of Harry Potter, without all the plot armor. Significant things actually go wrong and derail the hero&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>The <code>sympathy</code> magic system is rooted in logic and is fully understandable. Only the very smallest part of the system requires &ldquo;magic&rdquo;, and then physical laws take over from there. Newton&rsquo;s Laws and Conservation of Energy all work <em>with</em> <code>sympathy</code> to make the system both believable and reasonable. Once the hero becomes skilled at <code>sympathy</code>, he uses it to his advantage as much as possible, without forgetting it at plot-convenient times. An effective, yet simple and logical magic system like this is something that many books miss. There is a striking resembelence between <em>The Wheel of Time&rsquo;s</em> <em>The Flame and the Void</em> and <em>Alar</em> and <em>Heart of Stone</em>, but there remains more distance between them than the <em>Aiel</em> and <em>Adem</em>. That&rsquo;s a complaint for the sequal.</p>
<p>The story also makes extensive use of music, something which I know very little about and don&rsquo;t take a particular interest in. Yet somehow it was used in such a way that I began to care, and began to learn about the major themes. Music&rsquo;s importance to the hero made me start to care about music.</p>
<p>The book also touches significantly on the power of words and names. There is magic involved in knowing the name of some inanimate object, and then bending it to your will, but even more poignant is the descriptions of how words and names affect people and ourselves. Others are to us what we call them, and we become what we call ourselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We understand how dangerous a mask can be. We all become what we pretend to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although not fantastically quotable, there are a great many important lessons throughout the book. There&rsquo;s even a touch of stocism thrown in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just pity him, my boy. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be on our way, but he&rsquo;ll have to keep his own disagreeable company until the day he dies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, but firstly in the book, is the very clever storytelling perspective of the narrator and hero telling his own story to another character in the book. So most of the novel is spent in a story-in-story, with interludes of stepping out into &ldquo;present day&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a fun device that does a good job of breaking up the story into themed segments far more interesting than your average chapter.</p>
