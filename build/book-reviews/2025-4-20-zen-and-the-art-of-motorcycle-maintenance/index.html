  <p>Robert Pirsig</p>
<p>☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Quality is the measure of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>There, I&rsquo;ve solved it for everyone in a single sentence. The best thing you can possibly do is to stop reading now - stop reading this article, stop reading analyses of the book, and most certainly don&rsquo;t read the book itself. It is an absolute waste of time. In 400 pages, Pirsig manages to get close to this solution exaclty once, on page 300-something (I just can&rsquo;t be bothered with this book anymore&hellip;)[1].</p>
<p>He enjoys confusing quality with Quality, droning on about how they are so different, and inventing nonsensical worldviews in order to support the mental illness that he thinks is resolved but is clearly not. In that way, it was somewhat similar to <em>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</em>; providing a window into the reality of mental illness.</p>
<p>The books this one is most closely related to are those that you are forced to read in 8th grade English class and then over-analyze ad nauseum; being forced to invent themes and ideas the author never intended. <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>Animal Farm</em>, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>. These books sound like wisdom to an English major, but are barely foundational understandings of the world for the Engineer or Scientist. You don&rsquo;t need to pursue the ghost of reason to the end of the Earth. It&rsquo;s right there, plain and available for anyone. The only difficulty is that we need to avoid inventing difficulties in finding it. This book is the worst type of pseudo-intellectual garbage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this book will be the most dissapointing one I&rsquo;ve read in 2025, and probably the worst in absolute terms too. The fun part is that it&rsquo;s also in the running for the worst book I&rsquo;ve read <em>of all time</em>. It is: nonsensical, illigocal, wrong, and unaware of nearby facts. Furthermore, it seeks to show the author as mentally, ethically, and morally superior, while really only demonstrating that he&rsquo;s a miserable husband, father, and friend.</p>
<p>Lastly, I learned almost nothing of actual motorcycle maintenance, which is a significant disappointment. After the first few pages where he introduces &ldquo;points&rdquo; (more accurately called &ldquo;contact breakers&rdquo;, which were used prior to the invention of electronic spark distribution systems) as a thing that exists, but entirely fails to explain their purpose or how to actually adjust them, there are no real discussions of mechanical elements. For someone supposedly so obsessed with &ldquo;Quality&rdquo;, this is pathetic - obviously the most important job of a Disciple of Quality would be to introduce others to it in ways that make sense. Alas, Pirsig was never in the &ldquo;making sense&rdquo; game. Oh wait, the Man of Quality did shim his handlebars with a beer can once. Pretty Quality fix right there.</p>
<p>I think I can summarize what Pirsig is trying to say with his &ldquo;Quality&rdquo;: Physics exists. Humans have opinions because they perceive physics. Everything flows from those tautologies.</p>
<p>Well, duh.</p>
<p>Below, I shall copy and paste the copious notes I took while reading because I had heard so many positive recommendations and had such high hopes for this book.</p>
<p>P59. He gets the was and mean backwards.</p>
<p>P71. &ldquo;Might have created real friction otherwise.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re creating that friction! You just dumped your kid on the ground to wake him up. You&rsquo;re the jerk and problem here. And then a surprise totally with down tire, all of a sudden? But I thought you did the maintenance?</p>
<p>P80. Phaedrus&rsquo; use of the knife of division and definition being hurtful to himself makes sense to me. It&rsquo;s very possible to be so correct and precise that it&rsquo;s impossible for anyone outside your mind to keep up or understand and harm them in the use of your definitions.</p>
<p>P115. &ldquo;Number of rational&hellip;&rdquo; But rational is an incorrect assumption.</p>
<p>P149. Phaedrus gets all bent about loss of accreditation, but failed to realize that there is nothing truthful in the laws of physics about accreditation, it is their OPINION that the school has lost accreditation. And that REAL university may also continue without accreditation just fine.</p>
<p>P153. If you have doubt of reason, it&rsquo;s because of your lack of understanding or experience with it. It is impossible to doubt the logic of truth.</p>
<p>P184. Mental breakdown starts with asking students: What is quality in thought and statement? My answer in 30 seconds: Fitness for a particular task. The circular logic he gets into fits over is wrong and unnecessary.</p>
<p>P200. Grades in school are used to cover up bad teaching. This I agree with.</p>
<p>P229. I quite enjoyed the rhetoric dive into the defense of the undefinability of Quality. While he&rsquo;s still wrong, walking through the defenses was enjoyable.</p>
<p>P234. &ldquo;Zero&hellip; Was unknown to the ancient Greek and Romans.&rdquo;. Maybe by this name, but they understood the concept of Balance very well. If the scale balanced, the trade was equal whether it was weighing gold against gold or paper against a ratio of oxen. You can imagine a quantity of water that is just enough with none leftover to put out a flame, these are in balance and the differences in their energy is Zero.</p>
<p>P234. Computers use zero and one because that&rsquo;s what we label the voltages, and 0/Local-Ground happens to be easy to find. Could absolutely use the difference between any 2 voltages, and therefore operate on 42&rsquo;s and 97&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>P237? Falls into the trap of the idea-self centric world. If your little idea is the progenitor of all the ideas it is wrestling with, it must be the best. Or you have gotten something wrong because of incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>P247. At first this is a pretty good mind freak. But I shall refute it easily. If instead of looking at the tree, I sit under it, close my eyes and rest my back against it, to know that it exists, there is no time lag to my knowledge that the tree exists. Should it disappear I will know instantly without lag and then fall over. Could the tree instead have become the leg of an elephant? No. For humans are not the sum of their senses, my knowledge of the universe and view of zero approaching elephants tells me that reality is indeed constant.</p>
<p>P270. Concerned with uniting science and art. But only the idiot can look at the periodic table, the electromagnetic spectrum, orbital mechanics, fractals and the golden ratio, and not see true and obvious beauty.</p>
<p>P270. The whole discussion of Poincare sums up to say, science is only our perception and made-up names for measurements of things. But this is not true. Things exist outside our perception. You may call blue and red by the other&rsquo;s name, but that doesn&rsquo;t change their wavelength. Calling wavelength by trough-height doesn&rsquo;t change what physics is happening to the photon. And calling that photon by the name rose doesn&rsquo;t make it smell any sweeter, for smell is still not a property of rose-photon. Maybe this is the elusive Quality he searches for, but if so, becomes useless by defining everything as Quality. This is why we have other words, no matter the sound they make or letters they contain.</p>
<p>P272. He gives the philosophicaly &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answer, but the refusal to engage makes him and absolute failure of father, friend, conversationalist.</p>
<p>P280. &ldquo;Scientific method is only hindsight and has no creativity.&rdquo; False. There&rsquo;s an entire step devoted to thinking of new hypotheses, which is the creative part of creative problem solving. They can be based on older evidence and are therefore more likely to be in the right target area, but aren&rsquo;t required to be at all.</p>
<p>P287. The hero quote from the back of the book. “The solutions are all simple—after you have arrived at them. But they’re simple only when you know already what they are.” This is a losers mentality that assumes you have no action or choice of how the world goes, a philosopher who must sit and wait for the problem to be fixed all at once and then is permitted to record it. In direct opposition is the Engineer&rsquo;s view, that all solutions are simple because they each start with a single small step and build progress as the sum total of many efforts in the right direction.</p>
<p>Ch26. Discussion of gumption traps is pretty good. Normally they are known as logical fallacies but he got close. Problem is that every programmer knows the concept of NULL, no need to go all the way to Japan and pretend like mu is super exotic.</p>
<p>P360. &ldquo;Remember the description of the motorcycle given way back in south Dakota? The one which carefully enumerated all the motorcycle parts and functions?&rdquo; No! You never actually did that and that&rsquo;s the problem!!</p>
<p>P?. &quot; &hellip;only looking for facts that may help him and discarding all those that don&rsquo;t fit.&quot; Uhhhh yeah that&rsquo;s not how logic or rhetoric works whatsoever.</p>
