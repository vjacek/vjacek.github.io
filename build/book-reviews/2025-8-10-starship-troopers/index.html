  <p>Robert A. Heinlein</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Heinlein really had it it for democracy, which is great because democracy sucks. Here in 2025 it&rsquo;s become abundantly clear that democracy has failed in the United States, and we&rsquo;ve now got a front row seat to the slow but inevitable downfall. Heinlein absolutely nails two of the most important reasons why democracy in our form is doomed:</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask the impossible from our government and get upset when it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</li>
<li>Voters must be willing to put &ldquo;the group&rdquo; ahead of themselves. Which is impossible in heterogenous a group this large.</li>
</ul>
<p>I remember being assigned to argue for Federalism in A.P. U.S. History class in high school. At the time it seemed to make sense, unifying the States would give the country the ability to defend itself both militarily and economically from much more established nations, while not sapping it&rsquo;s own strength by punative disagreements with it&rsquo;s closest neighbors (the other states). In 2025, the fact that I&rsquo;m burdoned by high taxes in Massachusetts which are federally redistributed to other states makes much less sense. A federal goverment burdoned by the mission of writing laws for such a hugely diverse nation has little chance of success. Maybe it would indeed be better for those of similar ideals to congregate together and govern themselves; we&rsquo;d get exactly what we ask for, and potentially what we deserve.</p>
<p>This book is also clearly deeply inspiring to many Sci-Fi generations. It invents the Mjolnir armor from Halo, and the whole idea of double-jumping, seen in many video games. Simply letting go of a rocket launcher allows the smart armor to store it in inventory. It must also serve as direct literary inspiration for <a href="https://vjacek.github.io/book-reviews/2022-9-3-enders-game/"><em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a>: a philosopical war hero who undergoes extreme training and team building, and ultimately fights alien &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; of nebulous description.</p>
<p>Some of the best passages in literature must be Mr. Dubois&rsquo;s rhetoric and argument around the fall of North America</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, I was not making fun of you personally; I was heaping scorn on an inexcusably silly idea - a practice I shall always follow. Anyone who clings to the historically untrue - and thoroughly immoral - doctrine that &ldquo;violence never settles anything&rdquo; I would advise to conjure up the ghosts of Napoleon Bonaparte and The Duke of Wellington and let them debate it. The ghost of Hitler could referee, and the jury might well be the Dodo, the Great Auk, and the Passenger Pigeon. Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor, and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst. Breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and freedoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not understand objections to &lsquo;cruel and unusual&rsquo; punishment. While a judge should be benevolent in purpose, his awards should cause the crimial to suffer, else there is no punishment&hellip; &hellip;As for &lsquo;unusual&rsquo;, punishment <em>must</em> be unusual or it serves no purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never been able to see how a thirty-year-old moron can vote more wisely than a fifteen-year-old genius&hellip; but that was the age of the &lsquo;divine right of the common man.&rsquo; Never mind, they paid for their folly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since soverign franchise is the ultimate in human authority, we insure that all who wield it accept the ultimate in social responsibility - we require each person who wishes to exert control over the state to wager his own life - and lose it, if need be - to save the life of the state. The maximum responsibility a human can accept is thus equated to the ultimate authority a human can exert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only are our current democratic leaders not required to wager their lives to exert control over us, they are allowed to reward themselves for controlling the state. Quite the perverse incentive.</p>
