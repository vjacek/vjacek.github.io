<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>This book is a slog. It took weeks of forcing myself to return to it, and 400 pages to say nothing over and over again. The entire premise is that your life is better if you are &ldquo;nearer&rdquo; to God. &ldquo;Nearness&rdquo; is roughly defined as things that make your life &ldquo;better&rdquo;, and &ldquo;God&rdquo; is roughly defined as defined as being everywhere, in all things and thoughts, and the solution to all issues. I found this nearly 100% nebulousness nearly 100% unhelpful and impractical.</p>
<p>The book gives lots of advice wrapped up in methods, systems, and many steps of examining this, that, and the other thing, while recommending that you allow yourself to be led by a &ldquo;spiritual director&rdquo; who may or may not have your best interests at heart. And if you question their opinion, you need to find both faith and obedience, which it turns out is just another version of faith, but in another person with human opinions. The problem with all this faith is that it results in being forced to accept the need to find the good in bad situations, instead of taking action to improve the situation.</p>
<p>It turns out all these decision making machinations are just Stoicism with extra steps. It&rsquo;s like the &ldquo;show your work&rdquo; version of Stoicism. The &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answers end up just being ones that prioritize your happiness and fulfillment in the long term over short, while treating others fairly. The only wisdom of the monks appears to be the willingness, or acceptance of need, of doing those extra steps and extra work. They see the usefulness of spending time working on themselves. To this point, they&rsquo;ve arrived at the same excellent endpoint, and only dedicatad their entire lives to it&rsquo;s discernment. The Aurelian option would be to accept a few simple truths about the motivations that power yourself and others, while recognizing that the universe has none of the same.</p>
