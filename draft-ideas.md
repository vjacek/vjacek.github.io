- Ignoring things is more powerful than reading everything
  Lots of stuff outside of control can never all be read
- Organizing useful output - write logs, but good logs
- Process / workflow first, details second
- I love throwing stuff away
- Engineer s analysis of how to fold socks
- Umbrellas are the worst
- Usefullness is the Prime Directive of Design
- Prime Directive: make the computers do the work
- How to do a good job without caring because caring too much is what causes burnout
- Google opinion rewards and surveys aren't worth the phone notification and interruption
- The only way to kill old bad software is to write me things that are so easy and fast and good to use that people can't help but use them
- Story about how people who use newer tools are better (you're better if you have the latest iphone)
- Hybrid strategy always wins... On prem and spikes to cloud are stronger than either and don't waste idle resources....StarCraft troop mix
- Time isn't really a thing.... It's a label that humans have put on certain processes where we can observe a change in entropy.  Concept of a timeline is completely wrong. Like most reactions and processes we can catalyse time, Extinction of animals, travel from point to point, by using up the catalyst in the reaction
- Since the future is not defined yet and only predicted based on the past, you can't travel to it, and can't say meteor caused dino extinctions since Extinction wasn't pre determined..... Everything is in a constant state of IS....
- Time isn't linear or multi dimensional.... It's a point
- Yawkey next.    Due to a fatality.... Our definition about what to give a fuck about is so very strange. Nobody cares about the fatality just getting home on time
- Disruptor vs having such good innovative ideas and implementation that people can't help but actually want to use them and change tools or methods
- They can't bother you for updates if you beat them to it and make your work and progress transparent....
- Everything should be organized by frequency of access and cached, like toilet paper, one roll on the holder, 4 upstairs closet, 40 downstairs storage
- What if EVERYTHING was a moonshot project?
- management considered harmful
