### Hi, I'm Victor.

At work, I'm a Staff Software Engineer and have deep experience designing and building complex systems such as monitored 24/7 outdoor security, an all-new point of sale system with intelligent recommendations, an internal experimentation platform, and energy demand queueing. Besides building computer systems, I enjoy building teams and helping people devlop their skills and careers.

While the deliverables across market segments differ, the common thread is that everyone needs software, and being part of a team that is able to design and execute excellent software is a huge competitive advantage in the marketplace. But more importantly can help make a lot of people's lives better.

I graduated from [Umass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).

Outside of work, I still love building things:

[1headline](http://1headline.com) Take control of your media consumption with The Newsstand Theory: All the news you really need is available by walking past a newsstand and glancing at the front pages. No infinite scroll and intentionally minimal; stop wasting your time on sites where you're only an <span style="font-family: Courier">advertising_id</span>.

My [Photography](http://victorjacekphotography.com) work spans a wide range, with origins in landscape and architecture, and now including dynamic portraints in dance and cheer. Of course, I built my own portfolio website, including a neat solution that lets me add new photos without any code changes.
