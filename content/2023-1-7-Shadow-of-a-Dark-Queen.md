### Shadow of a Dark Queen
Raymond E. Feist  
&#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;

The Serpentwar Saga is off to an unfortunate start: we follow a mercenary company as they sail around for a bit, march here, march over there, march up those mountains, march back down the slightly easier other side of the mountain, march into a town, march out of a town, march into a meeting of companies, march away from the other companies, march through a strange magical tunnel that turns out to have absolutely no bearing on the story...  There's a huge amount of adventuring around in order to learn the super secret important information, but when the mission is completed, we're not even included on what the secret info was.  On the plus side, at the very end, lots of things explode, and there's a spectacular use of battle magic.

Two potential very important lessons are learnable: having rare and useful skills (especially if nobody knows you have them until you can save the day by using them) make you valuable, and that stepping into responsibility rewards you with the ability to keep stepping into further responsibility (and influence, or power).

This book is a weird dichotomy of high-quality prose and nearly non-existent plot.  Feist somehow manages to write an enjoyably readable book without having the characters do much of anything the whole time.  Although it's only Part 1 of the Serpentwar Saga, I'm disappointed that these nearly 500 pages feel like mostly just a starting point for later books.

Oh, and Jimmy the Hand barely has a cameo, which should be a crime.
