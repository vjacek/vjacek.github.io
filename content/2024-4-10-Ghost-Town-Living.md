This book is a great fast and fun read, regardless of your familiarity with Brent's Youtube channel about living in Cerro Gordo. If you are already familiar, it's a fascinating look behind the scenes into some of the details and off-camera hard work it has taken to start rebuilding a ghost town.

By far my favorite thing about the book however, is that Brent actually demonstrates what it looks like to live life as a Stoic. While many helpful sources talk about how the ancient Stoics thought about the world, or what a Stoic _should_ do in theory, Brent shares stories about how this philosophy has actually influenced his life in major ways. Rebuilding the Yellow Grade Road, rebuilding the American Hotel, rebuilding a writer's cabin, and rebuilding a water source each present both obstacles, and the way forward when you frame your own perspective correctly. Small and sometimes subtle shifts in this personal perspective have given him the mental fortutude to face significant challenges.

From Brent's stories of living in what used to be a ghost town, we can learn perspecitves that reshape our lives in meaningful ways. Read this book for some excellent stories of philosophy in real-life practice.
