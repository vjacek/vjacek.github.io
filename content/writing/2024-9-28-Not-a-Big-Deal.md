I just spent a day and a half being upset, when in reality both the cause and effect were simply quite small concerns.

For the technical context, I'm leading a project where we have several overseas engineers. They're smart and capable of good work, but frequently end up blocked by issues that simply wouldn't exist within the walled garden of being a full-time employee. Their accounts need all kinds of special access, setup takes longer, and they don't always have the project context that the rest of us do. In this case, we had a few tickets that required using a 3rd-party tool. Of course there was the usual frustration of setting up accounts (But the Stoic must ask: Why was this a frustration? Somebody was going to do work that I didn't want to, so that I didn't have to! And all I would have to do is start them on the path.), but then we found that they couldn't really use the tool because they were outside of the United States.

So, I frantically turned to Slack and spent the next several hours asking for somebody, anybody, to effectively "just fix it", but in many more words. "Legal concerns" was the given reason, so I took to justifying my requests over and over again to different groups, direct messages, and in person to my manager the next morning. Ideas and hacks on how to make the problem go away swelled and took hold in diverging directions as I thought I was demonstrating seniority and leadership by chasing down all possible solutions.

Maybe it was the approach of Friday and the end of the work week that gave a moment of pause, or maybe it was feeling myself approach the point of standing up and shouting for the Director of Product[1] to "Just deal with this already! Us Engineers have _better_ things to think about!", but lucid moment of calm had the chance to strike. I realized that my stress was my own, and furthermore, manufactured by noone but myself.

While stepping into a new leadership role can make it _seem_ like it's important for _everything_ to run smoothly, that's not really true. A few bumps in the road are expected and even planned for. We have systems for this and know how to handle them; and colleagues who we can ask for help. As knowledge workers, we are valued at work precisely for the self-moderation of knowing when to escalate issues among competing priorities or allow a course of action to run naturally.

The correct course of action would have to simply accept the first "no", but as the starting point of a conversation. To step back, and think through how we could change that to agreement. I've seen many times a quick "no" can become a considered "yes" - that's how guardrails _should_ work. Seek to build bridges instead of barreling through the nearest wall.

Our contact in the Legal department is going to get to it. Tomorrow afternoon. Because he's _moving_. What a perspective shift - the stress and uncertainty of picking up and moving your family and home, compared to a few tickets that will take a few days longer to get done. The servers were not on fire. Our cloud infrastructure was not spinning up rogue instances and exponential costs. Nobody's job was at stake.

I'm much better at learning from mistakes than I am from success. Part of the mistake here was my valuation of the work to begin with. I wanted someone else to handle these tickets so that I didn't have to. Would it have been a good use of my time to just handle these tickets myself? Absolutely not. But were they actually _beneath_ me? Absolutely not.

In another way, it's immensely humbling to realize how much time and energy I gave to this. 12 work hours - spent distracted instead of solving technical challenges. But a day and a half of my life. Time in anger and frustration, _when there was no need_. Only I brought this stress upon myself. It's not the problem's fault for existing - yes it exists, but it has no inherint malice. It is therefore within our power to discard our own angers and frustrations, becuase we were the ones to pick them up in the first place.

There may be times when it's appropriate to call in all the reinforcements at your disposal. This certainly wasn't one of them, and they're probably further off that we first think.

[1] He's a smart and influential person, which is why I wanted him to solve my problem - and he would have. But going about it that way would have been a frivilous spend of career capital. I want to be seen as someone who handles his own problems and clears the way for others, not the person who is loud about small things.
