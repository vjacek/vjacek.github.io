Atomic Habits easily gets 5 stars from me, and it's easy to see why it continually tops bestseller lists. It's a fast and fun read with compelling and concrete examples. As I'm sure it was designed to, it inspires the reader to start working on new habits and recognize that their true power will be apparent only after the accumulation of a great many rounds of practice.

Clear summarizes this as motion "about" or "near" an objective is ineffective relative to motion "directly towards" the objective. Habits recommend and show the positive effect of a "journey is the destination" approach. This dips into Stoicism with some powerfully simple mindset shifts. A burden can be turned into an opportunity and chance to be thankful for the challenge. The very fact that challenges have a potential for failure makes them worthy of our effort.

> The 4 Laws of Behavior Change:
> Make it obvious.
> Make it attractive.
> Make it easy.
> Make it satisfying.

> The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

> When you can't win by being better, you can win by being different.

Makes me think of the Kobayashi Maru. Always look for alternatives. Rules don't really exist.

> A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.
