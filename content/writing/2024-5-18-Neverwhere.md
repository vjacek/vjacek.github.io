Neil Gaiman

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;

Nobody writes hallucinations like Neil Gaiman; to my judgement, he's the undisputed master. _Neverwhere_ is another wonderful example of this ability, and takes the reader on a fast, weird, and wonderful journey into the opposite of a normal, common, place. That weirdness is exactly what makes the book so readable and enjoyable - you feel both comfortable with the common, but excited to see it in a new light.

In the edition I read, the author's _preferred_ edition I might add, the ending of the story is 40 pages from the end of the stack of paper due to an incorrectly placed prologue. This made for a surprise ending because of where it was in the book, and an exciting ending when you realize this was indeed the end.

_Neverwhere_ contains perhaps one of the most clever passages in fiction -

> The sky was the perfect untroubled blue of a television screen, tuned to a dead channel.

This references the opening line of _Neuromancer_ by William Gibson, the book that invented cyberpunk. Gibson's original television must have been from the 70's or earlier, where white-and-black static dead channels struggled to resolve images with chaotic crackling energy, perfectly setting the scene of the troubled but electrifying Sprawl.

Gaiman sets exactly the opposite scene with a 90's television with a VCR plugged in, signal strong, and ready to happily play whatever tape it's given.

Another line goes in my "Insults Hall of Fame" for it's direct and completeness -

> You are all very stupid people, and you do not know anything at all.

The key here being to say it in a gracious manner befitting the Abbot of the Black Friars.
