There's a whole class of internet-based complaints about the current language used by, I think, middle schoolers of the moment. These complaints center around both newly invented words and existing words that have been assigned new meanings, interchangable with their old forms. The small-minded complainers take their outrage over these "brainrot" words to the internet, while the rest of us, if you've even heard a Gen-Alpha talk lately (I certainly haven't), simply ignore them in the normal time-tested tradition.

Here's the thing - Gen-Alpha is right. "Brainrot" lingo is swell, groovy, sweet, and is giving sigma W.

The explanation is simple. Adapting to a quickly evolving language with dynamic and inconsistent rules and connotations demonstrates a superior mental flexibility. Cognitive plasticity has already become the most important skill in knowledge work and fantastically epitomizes an old adage: adapt or die.

It's a great big beautiful tomorrow.

In the words of Brandon Sanderson, a somewhat(1) better writer than myself, in his book _Tress of the Emerald Sea_ -

> I’m not one of those people who care if you use words wrong. I prefer it when words change meaning. The imprecision of our language is a feature; it best represents the superlative fact of human existence: that our own emotions — even our souls — are themselves imprecise. Our words, like our hearts, are weapons still hot from the forging, beating themselves into new shapes each time we swing them.

Skibidi.
