There's nothing necissarily _new_ or _remarkable_ about this book, and that's perfectly fine. Fans of Jimmy the Hand will thoroughly enjoy a return to Jimmy's street-smart antics ranging from Krondor to Kesh.

There's no Asimov Twist at the end like many of Feist's books, but I'm still angry about the character he killed, and especially at the way it happened. I begrudgingly suppose that means the writing was immersive.
