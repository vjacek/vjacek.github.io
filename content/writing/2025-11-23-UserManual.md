### My style

### What I value

### What I don't have patience for

People who don't try their best.

Being new to something is totally ok. Getting something wrong is fine. And having a lot to learn is great.

But low effort is not acceptable. I have much more respect for someone who says "I'm not interested in this, I'll step away" than the person who pretends to try.

### How best to communicate with me

### How to help me

### What people misunderstand about me

My curiosity can be mistaken for criticality.

I seek to learn and understand everything I can about the world, which means I need to ask questions. Sometimes when I ask people those questions, they can feel like I'm interrogating the person or being critical of their idea, when I'm genuinley seeking to expand my understanding.

### A moment/person/advice that has shaped who I am today

"If someone put this together, I can take it apart" - me

I believe that the engineered world is the epitome of welcoming spaces, becuase someone had to design, build, and assemble the widget in front of all of us. They were only human. Which means we are all capable of looking at that widget, it's form and function, and understanding _why_ it is the way it is.
