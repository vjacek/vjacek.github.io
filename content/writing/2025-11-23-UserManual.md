### My style

I'm solution focused. I enjoy the process of hardening ideas by poking holes in them. I believe in collaborative strategy and individual accomplishment.

### What I value

The ability to learn. The creativity to synthesize information across systems. The confidence to question assumptions, and the humility to do it respectfully.

### What I don't have patience for

People who don't try their best.

Being new to something is totally ok. Getting something wrong is fine. [And having a lot to learn is great.](https://xkcd.com/1053/)

But low effort is not acceptable. I have much more respect for someone who says "I'm not interested in this, I'll step away" than the person who pretends to try.

### How best to communicate with me

Use periods of high intensity collaboration to figure out plans and goals, then individual focus time to implement it.

Using coworkers as a knowledge repository through Slack kills focus with death-by-a-thousand-messages.

Good documentation _is_ good communication.

In terms of feedback, I appreciate plain and direct words when it comes to mistakes. Criticism is always welcome, but giving it carries the responsibility of showing a better path forward.

### How to help me

Give me more context. Sometimes my wife says that I act like an 8 year old, and when it comes to asking "Why?", I'll take that as a compliment. If you want me on your team or onboard with your idea, show me all the cool reasons why it's the best solution and I'll be your biggest supporter.

### What people misunderstand about me

My curiosity can be mistaken for criticality.

I seek to learn and understand everything I can about the world, which means I need to ask questions. Sometimes when I ask people those questions, they can feel like I'm interrogating the person or being critical of their idea, when I'm genuinley seeking to expand my understanding.

### A moment/person/advice that has shaped who I am today

"If someone put this together, I can take it apart" - me

I believe that the engineered world is the epitome of welcoming spaces, because someone had to design, build, and assemble the widget in front of all of us. They were only human. Which means we are all capable of looking at that widget, it's form and function, and understanding _why_ it is the way it is. We're all capable of fixing it when broken, and improving it for the future.
