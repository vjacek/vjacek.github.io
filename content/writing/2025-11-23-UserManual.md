title: "User Manual"

The company I work for was recently sold from one private equity group to another private equity group. While I'm sure there are significant changes coming, the new executives have started their tenure not by handing down directives, but by listening and gathering input. One of the ways they are doing this was to ask the Leadership Team (Senior Directors and Distingished Engineers) to complete a "User Manual" exercise. Two of those people in my group were kind enough to share their own manuals and inspire this one.

Of course, none of the executive team needs _my_ user manual, but with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, it seemed like a very interesting introspective exercise to try for myself.

### My style

I'm solution focused; finding elegant and effecient solutions excite me. I enjoy the process of hardening ideas by attempting to poke holes in them. I believe in collaborative strategy and individual accomplishment. I'm thoroughly uninterested in placing blame on the creator of an idea that doesn't work, but I believe that dissecting the idea itself will yeild new knowledge.

### What I value

The ability to learn. The creativity to synthesize information across systems. The confidence to question assumptions, and the humility to do it respectfully. The importance of good strategy, and the ability to dynamically deal with changing circumstances. Honesty with allies.

### What I don't have patience for

People who don't try their best.

Being new to something is totally ok. Getting something wrong is fine. [And having a lot to learn is great.](https://xkcd.com/1053/)

But low effort is not acceptable. I have much more respect for someone who says "I'm not interested in this, I'll step away" than the person who pretends to participate.

### How best to communicate with me

Use periods of high intensity collaboration to figure out plans and goals, then individual focus time to implement it.

Using coworkers as a knowledge repository via Slack kills focus with death-by-a-thousand-messages.

Good documentation _is_ good communication, even though we usually don't track it like we do other forms of communication.

In terms of feedback, I appreciate plain and direct words when it comes to mistakes. Criticism is always welcome, but giving it carries the responsibility of showing a better path forward.

### How to help me

Give me more context. Sometimes my wife says that I act like an 8 year old, and when it comes to asking "Why?", I'll take that as a compliment. If you want me on your team or onboard with your idea, show me all the cool reasons why it's the best solution and I'll be your biggest supporter.

### What people misunderstand about me

My curiosity can be mistaken for criticality.

I seek to learn and understand everything I can about the world, which means I need to ask questions. Sometimes when I ask people those questions, they can feel like I'm interrogating the person or being overly critical of their idea, when I'm genuinely seeking to expand my understanding.

### A moment/person/advice that has shaped who I am today

_Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius

I'm a student of Stoic philosiphy and believe that the first step of being a good teammate is to be in good control of your own self first, especially when it's not easy. The most challenging situations provide the greatest opportunity for growth.

"If someone put this together, I can take it apart." - me

I believe that the engineered world is the epitome of welcoming spaces, because someone had to design, build, and assemble the widget in front of all of us. They were only human. Which means we are all capable of looking at that widget, it's form and function, and understanding _why_ it is the way it is. With some effort and experience, we're all capable of fixing it when broken, and improving it for the future.
