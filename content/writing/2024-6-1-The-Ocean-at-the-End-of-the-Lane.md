Neil Gaiman

My best description for this book is that it's _American Gods_ about kids. Most likely not _for_ kids, unless the kids you know enjoy being terrified of all sorts of things being weird and wrong. I think the correct genre label for this book is actually horror. It thankfully didn't give me nightmares or get me jumpy, but I know myself enough to know that I don't care for horror; I'd rather experience something else. This is probably my least-favorite Gaiman book.

I didn't care much for this book as a whole, but it's a difficult to articulate the exact shortcomings. Mostly I think it's a matter of preference for setting. This book takes place largely in and around a rural Engish cottage. I suppose this is supposed to be a comfortable or even cozy scene, but I simply don't identify with it.

Later portions are spent in a wet, muddy thunderstorm, running across sloppy fields. I love thunderstorms, but that's the wrong kind. Thunderstorms are supposed to be fresh, exciting, and cleansing. Something you can wait with anticipation for as it rolls in with it's special smell on a special breeze, revel in the power as the sky rages while safely inside your garage or picnic pavillion, and then explore a new world that's been transformed by the storm once it passes.
