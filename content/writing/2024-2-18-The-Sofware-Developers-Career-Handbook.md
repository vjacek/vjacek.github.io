This book suffers from an unfortunate case of being a product of a very specific time and set of circumstances. Moving from waterfall to agile, lunchtime card games, all-staff meetings, and working weekends to "ship" are all bygones in 2024. Originally written 10 years ago and just now supposedly updated then repackaged, the book does not hold up. Concrete lessons are few and far between, with the most helpful sections focusing on identifying the personalities of different players in the corporate game. Lopp's best insights come from the fact that once you identify those personalities, then their motivations, then their intentions, then their plays, then you can be one or more steps ahead of them and make situations into wins for yourself. He also makes a very compelling case for how lying at work is awesome, everyone is doing it all the time, you should lie too, and even more importantly, you should learn to figure out when others are lying to you. The most salient point is that you should have a career plan: what work do you want to be involved in, who do you want to work with, and how are you going to manage yourself into those positions. Work with intent.
