This book generally stinks. One of the large fatal flaws is usually a strength for Sanderson - the magic system of "boasts" consists of, as best I can tell because it's not ever really explained, weird poems about how the boaster is great. The other, and totally disconnected, magic comes from the actions of wights who kindly perform exactly the correct task at exactly the correct time, for small offerings of fruits and nuts. Even if I personally didn't care for this magic system, it's not really explained or even demonstrated enough to get the reader a comfortable understanding of the system.

The other major fatal flaw is that all the story development is simply thrown at the reader at the last possible moment. There is no build towards action; we don't get clues or insight into the hero's plan, we're just along for the ride as ideas pop into his head and are immediately executed. People and their motives are just invented from thin air when necessary to move forwards. Maybe that's a problem with the white room style, but it really hurts here.

Lastly in the fatal flaws is my complete inability to connect or sympathize with the protagonist in nearly any way. He's a self-proclaimed quitter with no follow through and lots of push over. Right after this, I picked up _Tress of the Emerald Sea_ and can already tell it will be a 5-star book; the hero couldn't be more different and the story is so much better for it.

Moving on to flaws that are each mortal wounds but not fatal by themselves, it feels like the word "skop" is a Sanderson-family in-joke that we're not clued in on and is poorly shoehorned into being a core theme of the story.

The hero gets the girl immediately after the big battle, with little to no romance or suspense throughout the story.

Also, medieval Anglo Saxon England is about the most boring and uninteresting setting for a story.
