### Jurassic Park  
Michael Chrichton  
&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;  

I somehow made it through the 90s without ever seeing *Jurassic Park* the movie, so when I found a paperback copy of *Jurassic Park* the book at the Northborough Library Book Sale, I figured this was my opportunity to do it the right way.

Read the book first, then watch the movie.

I've always known that dinosaurs are just about the coolest creatures ever, and Tyrannosaurus king among them.  I've stood in awe of fossil skeletons of T. Rex in Washington D.C. (MOR555), and New York City (AMNH5027), as well as replications of SUE (FMNH PR2081) both in Boston and Disney's Animal Kingdom.  Including replications, I've seen 10% of the discovered T. Rex fossils, which is pretty awesome. [1]

But I've never felt *afraid* of being eaten by a T. Rex before.

This is the singular power of books.  Movies may be fascinating, action-packed, and have the viewer on the edge of their seat, but the emotion of *fear* only translates so perfectly through a medium which requires your own imagination.  Maybe this is proof that I have a good imagination; I hope so.

Looking at photos of those same skeletons now, imagining those creatures alive and hungry, imagining myself getting flung from a crushed and tumbled Land Cruiser in the middle of a dark thunderstorm, with rain soaking everything and turning all the ground to mud, then needing to keep perfectly still to avoid attention of the terrible lizard hunting me just feet away...  That's actually terrifying.

I've written this so far while only having read half way through the book, and it gets an automatic 5-star review for the nightmare fuel of being hunted by a T. Rex.  There might be more to write, but I certainly won't need to.

Upon finishing the book, the only necessary addition is taking note of this wonderful insult:

> "Simple?  You're a bigger fool than I thought you were.  And I thought you were a very substantial fool."

- Dr. Ian Malcolm
