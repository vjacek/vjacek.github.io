### The Name of the Wind

Patrick Rothfuss

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;

At almost 700 pages, this is far from the longest book I've ever read, but I read it faster than some books 1/3 it's size. Perhaps an even greater compliment is that I stayed up hours late reading to finish the story.

The story itself is actually nothing all that earth-shattering: our hero is orphaned as a young boy, learns hard lessons on the street, finds himself clever enough to make it to the magical University, and then excells in lessons, while causing a modicum of trouble. The story strikes me as a more logical and fully-developed version of Harry Potter, without all the plot armor. Significant things actually go wrong and derail the hero's journey.

The `sympathy` magic system is rooted in logic and is fully understandable. Only the very smallest part of the system requires "magic", and then physical laws take over from there. Newton's Laws and Conservation of Energy all work _with_ `sympathy` to make the system both believable and understandable. Once the hero becomes skilled at `sympathy`, he uses it to his advantage as much as possible, without forgetting it at plot-convenient times. An effective, yet simple and logical magic system like this is something that many books miss.

The story also makes extensive use of music, something which I know very little about. Yet somehow it was used in such a way that I began to care, and began to learn about the major themes. Music's importance to the hero made me start to care about music.

The book also touches significantly on the power of words and names. There is magic involved in knowing the name of some inanimate object, and then bending it to your will, but even more poignant is the descriptions of how words and names affect people and ourselves. Others are what we call them, and we become what we call ourselves.

> We understand how dangerous a mask can be. We all become what we pretend to be.

There's even a touch of stocism thrown in:

> Just pity him, my boy. Tomorrow we'll be on our way, but he'll have to keep his own disagreeable company until the day he dies.
