### The Deep Range
Arthur C. Clark  
&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734;  

This book is classic Sci-Fi at it's best - a plucky protagonist with a few more smarts and skills than average takes on a new mission, a mission that he succeeds at in fact, until the pivotal brain-bending twist that forces you to step back and think "What If?".  

This "What If?" moment is my favorite thing about Sci-Fi, and to me, the facet that defines it.  While most of the world feels familiar, although time and technically advanced, the extra leap of faith completely breaks the reading experience, pulls you out of the story, and leaves you considering the repercussions still days later.  This sort of profound experience is amazing fun; I've found it in a few other places: *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*, *Ender's Game*, and first watching *The Matrix* 

In the case of *The Deep Range*, I might just become a vegitarian.

The only negative thing I can say about *The Deep Range* is that the protagonist mostly has things go too well for too long.  I feel that the best stories have a series of problems the hero must solve, steadily increasing in difficulty until the final battle (preferably of wits).
