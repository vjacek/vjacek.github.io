### The Slow Regard of Silent Things

Patrick Rothfuss

&#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;

I'm going to start listening to any book that opens with "You might not want to read this book." The problem is that I really did want to read this book, or at least the story that I thought it would be great if it contained. I wanted to read about how Auri came to be who she is and live where she does, and why her view of the world is shaped the way it is.

The book is none of those things. THe most problematic reason is that there was zero storyline to this book, only 100% descriptions of small details in the present day. No character development whatsoever, just description. If a character does something, there needs to be a `because`. Not even immediately, but eventually, it's important to understand why they did something instead of the opposite. Otherwise, your characters are as flat as animals or machines, statically reacting to their environment.

This does have the side-effect of giving me the clearest insight into mental illness that I've ever had. As someone who mostly tries as hard as possible to stay away from mental illness, the book does a good job of presenting such a warped view of the normal world in a way that makes warped seem normal. Rothfuss clearly has a gift for writing empathetic characters, but it's poorly harnessed here.
