This book is a fun, quick, and entertaining read, but the best part is that it's a techno-thriller that doesn't get anything wrong. Although this shouldn't be the accomplishment that it is, not getting any technical details wrong really is quite notable. I'm constantly complaining that an author decided to include detail they didn't need to, and then got some part of that detail wrong. There isn't a huge amount of detail in the tech elements, but it does manage to explain cryptocurrency correctly while maintaining the story's immersion.

This book also provids a good point to update and clarify my thinking about the star ratings that I give books. My intent with star ratings has become to approximate how much I would recommend a book if we were discussing it in person. I attempt to answer "Should you read it?", not "Excellence on an absolute scale."
