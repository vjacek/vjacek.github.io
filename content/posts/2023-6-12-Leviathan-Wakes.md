### Leviathan Wakes

I can't really figure out why this book was 600 pages long.  There's not a huge amount of action, intrigue, and certainly not suspense.  Oh, except that GRRM blurbed the cover and the proles think he's the only fiction author to ever exist, despite ample evidence that he's both a terrible and lazy writer.

Characters and places are described directly, but in the wrong sort of way.  "You're an idealist." one will say to another, without the reader having seen proof of such previously.  I guess we're just supposed to believe whatever the latest character says out loud.

The most irksome part of Leviathan Wakes is how clearly the author learned one single fact about outer space, and then used it completely up when writing.  If I have to hear about a ship's acceleration in multiples of `g` again, I'm going to accelerate the book through a defenestration zone at several multiples of `g`.  Furthermore, `g` simply isn't a good benchmark when dealing with space flight throughout the solar system.  9.81ms^2 only happens to be exactly `1g` on Earth!  The martians don't care to measure anything in `g`, and people born out past the asteroid belt certainly have no frame of reference why `1g` is `1g`.  You can't keep telling us how tall the Asteroid "Belters" are because they grew up in low gravity, and also expect them to care about the value of `1g`!  Their `1g` is completely different.  This is just basic General Relativity.

And don't use common phrases like "worth your weight in gold" when humanity has been multi-planetary for several generations.  The correct phrase would become "worth your *mass* in gold" so that it correctly applies across the solar system and not just on Earth, a place most people have never been anymore.  I guess you could say "worth your weight in gold at 1g" since that's our only outer space factoid.

The book is also needlessly vulgar.  I don't mind when vulgarity is somehow *useful*, (although I contend that this is rare) or conveys extreme emotion, but here's an example of when it certainly isn't.  When talking about a communications array of collimated lasers, the array is said to be able to light up your asshole from across the solar system.  I get that the author is trying to describe a fairly small beam angle, but aren't there several more interesting and relevant things about the same size?  The sensors on the warhead of a nuclear torpedo of your starfighter, the captain's uniform insignia that you just unexpectedly inherited, or even an eyeball, you know, the only organ that can actually sense light and would perceive a stimulus by being lit up by the comm array.

One more thing because I'm on a roll of dunking on this book's lack of tech and scientific knowledge - Nobody can "probably hack it" for values of "it" which are multi-generationally-futuristic smartphones being accessed only through their standard touchscreen interface with no tools or external interference generators.

Blah.
