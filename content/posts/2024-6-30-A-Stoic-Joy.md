Much of what I write is about books - I enjoy reading and learning from the lessons inside their stories. This time, I'm sharing an observation, really just a perspective of the world I chanced upon.

We've spent the last week in the Pocono Mountains, a rural and picturesque area of Pennsylvania sprinkled evenly with one-street coal towns and million-dollar resorts. The National Competition for the dance year is the main event; bottom-tier contestants cry as they run off stage after receiving an Elite Gold medal, and the best are awarded Premier Battle of Champions Crystal Trophies, Golden Tickets, Banners, and Pins. Competition is a place of extremes, where the extreme bottom starts at the natural top, and the adulations always ascend.

I started writing this as I'm sitting outside at the Kalahari resort. I found a back deck that probably hosts very expensive and private parties most nights... It's filled with a dozen 120-gallon decorative planters, propane fire tables, and big couches arranged into multiple seating areas. It's only about 4pm so I'm stealing time until somebody comes to kick me out in order to make the space "exclusive".

But the part I enjoy most is the amazing breeze. It's a really good breeze - the day has been broiling hot and I'm tired from hiking a few hours around Centralia, but the wind is now constant yet interestingly variable. Cooling, calming, refreshing, exhilirating, and a little too strong - but just right. This patio is also quiet and away from people and commotion. And I have a great book! I look up and realize my enjoyment of this place has nothing to do with this place.

The "resort" amenities, the awards and glitter next door, the expensive furnishings and exclusive setting - none of it matters in the moment, and my first few years of Stoic practice might finally be sinking in.

The things that actually made the moment grand were few and free.

The breeze.

The quiet.

A book.

...

And I got to watch a storm roll in.
