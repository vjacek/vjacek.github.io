This book's severe simplicity brings the readability down to, in my estimation, around an 6th grade level. The writing is pretty lackluster and boring, but the core messages are actually very solid. It just takes far too many pages to say too little about these ideas.

"Holy Moments" are first defined as when someone chooses to take a Good action instead of a Bad.

Given that definition, the book's entire premise is that you are free to choose at any time to make Good decisions instead of Bad decisions, and that a history or consistency of making similar choices over time compound to make you a Good person or a Bad person, who is able to reap the benefits of being Good, or conversely the difficulties of being Bad.

Around half way through, the book picks up another solid message: if we seek _progress_ at all costs, especially without any moral guidance or compass, we instead get only _change_ which does not move ourselves or each other forwards. By prioritizing metrics such as economic growth or short-term indulgences at the expense of how we treat each other, we are actually moving society backwards.
