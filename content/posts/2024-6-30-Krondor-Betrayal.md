The definition of a solid fantasy book without being a absolute smash hit. It's a good book; just go read it.

Interestingly, this book was based on the Video Game _Betrayal at Krondor_, which I did not play, but sets up the plot for _Tear of the Gods_ which is based on _Return to Krondor_, a game that I played the absolute heck out of the summer before 6th grade (1999). _Return to Krondor_ was thoroughly formative in defining what many parts of I consider a good video game, and I still quote it often.

_That's the beauty of it!_

Writing Lesson: Running all around the kingdom and back again _can_ work in fiction, but there must be compelling reasons why the heros need to do it, and there must be a payoff when they accomplish it. This book delivers both.
