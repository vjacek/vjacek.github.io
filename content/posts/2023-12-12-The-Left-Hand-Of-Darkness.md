This book really sucks. Mostly for the completely wasted opportunities of fairly good ideas. A world too cold for insects and animals larger than a dog to survive, yet with still active volcanic zones. People who are both genders. Explorers from worlds light years away making contact with primitive humans and bringing them into a universal community. Actually, that last one had a documentary about it called Stargate.

Each of these gets such a surface-level treatment that it gets really frustrating to hear just a little about it without really doing any exploration of the idea. This book strikes me as the kind they make you read in high school and then pretend is terribly artistic, while analyzing every small detail in ways that the author never envisioned or intended.

This book is also in extreme violation of my rule of not introducing too many new words. Mostly, these come in the form of proper nouns, which is even worse. It does the reader absolutly no good to differentiate countries or people or places when they are only mentioend once, and in no context or relation to anything else except to make "there" different from "here".

If you need both a foreword and afterword to your book in order to tell readers how much they should enjoy and appreciate it, those readers will quickly realize that if the story and characters had been good from the beginning, neiher would be necessary.
