In a quote that I can neither exactly remember nor find, in which some terribly heretical 19th-century socialist extolls the absurdity of limiting a work day to 8 hours, they also comment on the remaining 8 hours of leisure, rest, and relaxation time that each man has available at the end of the workday, and before the biologically required 8 hours of sleep.  The main point is that every man is free to conduct himself exactly like the wealthy for those 8 hours.  No matter the man's station at work, or the fact that he must work at all to provide for his family, in those remaining 8 hours, equality is governed by self-directed purpose.  He might study the fine arts of literature and painting, attend the theater, or study philosophy.  In the "other 8" hours, there is no limit to the type of activities a man is allowed to undertake.

Having achieved some amount of success in my chosen craft of software engineering, it becomes possible to commit less personal time to career advancement, and more time to a leisure pursit.  Ideally, this non-work focused craft is a source of both interest and mental rejuvination that supports my career in it's contrast to it.  

In order to achieve that, I believe it necessary to achieve a high level of expertise.  And in order to achieve high expertise, I believe it necessary to focus effort on fewer activities.  In all pursuits, breadth and depth are inversely related.  For someone who enjoys the learning process and gathering knowledge about all parts of the universe, an obvious problem arises: what singular pursuit is worthy of such attention?

Of course, the right way to solve such an emotional and personal commitment is with a spreadsheet.

Before we do that, it's necessary to invent a measurement system.

I first made a list of all hobbies that I've previously expolored, and that I could reasonably center all further interests upon.  Next, another list was made of all the properties that I'm personally looking for in an ideal activity.  The critical piece of the calculation is then weighting each property by it's importance to me.  I picked a single property
