### The Secret Lives of Color

I think I read this book incorrectly.  I approached it in the usual manner; starting at the front, making progress one page at a time, until all pages have been turned in order.  Progress was measured in groups of 10-20 pages, covering the stories of 2-5 individual colors at a time.

There are other valid methods however, and it seems a wise reminder to not automatically approach every scenario with only the exact techniques that have worked in the past.  Far better is to build a toolbox of skills, and know when to deploy each one to it's greatest effect.

As a daily magazine or newspaper article, the 2 or 3 page summaries of each color would easily be my favorite part of the paper.  A whole book filled with short snippets, while each is itself interesting, grows tiresome without more continuity and depth.  The stories are completely standalone, so when reading them in large groups, both holes and repetition emerge.  

Several colors trace their historical composition to Lead, so learning more about what makes this element so good for pigments would have added significant depth of interest.  The blue group's natural rarity would have been another interesting branch; the search, difficulties of creation, and economic impacts all being unique from the relatively ubiquitous reds.  We also hear about a number of painters and their adoption of certain colors.  Lining up their timeline and evolution of work with the discovery and creation of paletts, in contrast to their peers, would have been more interesting than each color stating the year in which someone started using it.

So while aditional depth would be possible, that should not be considered a requirement of this brief survey of many colors.  Using all the tools available to a reader is most definitely a requirement in all cases.
