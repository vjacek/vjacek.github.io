### The Secret Lives of Color

I think I read this book incorrectly.

As a weekly magazine or newspaper article, the 2 or 3 page summaries of each color would easily be my favorite part of the paper.  A whole book filled with short snippets, while each is itself interesting, grows tiresome without more continuity.
