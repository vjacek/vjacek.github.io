This book took me probably 6 months to finish. I picked it up several times, but struggled to find it interesting enough to finish and frequently moved on to a new book. I would have greatly preferred to simply read stories about Shetty's time in the ashram, and how he applies those lessons to modern life.

It sits at the intersection of productive self-improvement and philosophy, so ostensibly a very interesting subject. Indeed, a few excellent points are made, and the similarity between India's Bhagavad Gita and Roman Stoicism is absolutely striking. The more philosophy I study, the more I come to believe that any personal reasoning system must be a reflection or view of Stocism.

_Think Like a Monk_ ends up being something I would recommend if you're looking for a first self-improvement or self-study book, but it does some silly things that make it a generally boring read once you've been exposed to these ideas once. Each chapter has a "Try This!" section with overly simplified steps that make you feel like you're doing a gradeschool worksheet. Then there are silly graphics like "magic quadrant" charts and the like which duplicate what you've just read, but in a quirky handwriting font to make it feel like a page directly from Shetty's notebook. This really fails to be interesting.

That said, I took away a few nuggets of golden wisdom:

- Be wary of the Ego's ability to make yourself think you know too much,. This is the easiest way to ignore good new input.

- Do not expect anyone to be good, or a role model in all ways. Learning a single lesson from someone can be plenty. It is then your task to assemble the positive characters you meet into the best possible version of yourself.
