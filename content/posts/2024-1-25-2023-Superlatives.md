For the first time, probably ever, I think I actually own all the books I read in the previous year. So while I enjoy ranking books, among other things, doing it physically is a fun twist!

If I had to place a dividing line, I'd put only the top 4, The Deep Range and above, into my "highly recommended" list for the year. I'm proud of myself for trying such a wide range of books, but in the future I would rather increse the percentage of books that I really enjoy.

_Best Book_ - Jurassic Park, easily. I also recently watched the movie for the first time, and while it was a good movie, the book was still MUCH better!

_Heard a Lot About, So I'm Glad to Have Finally Read_ - The Name of the Wind and Good Omens. These books both rank so highly because of the "Pulls You In" factor.

_Most Disappointing_ - The Left Hand of Darkness. This shows up all the time in "Top Sci-Fi Books of all Time" lists, and I can't understand why. It totally fails to really explore it's supposed main theme.

_Worst Sequal_ - The Wise Man's Fear, then The Slow Regard of Silent Things. These keep getting worse! Which is incredibly disappointing because the first in the series was so very good!

_Changed my Point of View_ - The Deep Range changed my view for the better and expanded how I think about the universe. American Sniper really made me think much worse of the military, particularly those who make it their whole identity.
