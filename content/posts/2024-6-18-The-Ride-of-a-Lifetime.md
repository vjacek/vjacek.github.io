This book is awesome because Iger talks about why things were hard, and what he did to face them. He uses examples to color the ideas with story that draws you in, and neatly summarizes those ideas in ways that flow and teach. If you read this book through once and make an earnest attempt to learn anything from it, you'll be a dozen leadership steps ahead of a certain billionaire I know.

The wisdom of Iger's writing is that he gives very approachable and applicable lessons through telling stories about his life. His advice is through the lens of the story that he lived, and why he found each aspect important. This is the perfect example of "show, don't tell" done correctly.
