Raymond E. Feist

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;

This book is approximately the definition of "fine". It has a little bit of Pug blasting an evil sorcerer, troubled youths getting into mischief, and beautiful medieval sewer exploration. But all of these things feel like the "light" version with surface level descriptions and a lot of jumping around. There's also a whole plot line with robots that goes nowhere (yet, although it's probably continued in the rest of the 3 book series).

Interestingly, Feist clearly took some inspiration from the Fantasy Greats:

Discussing the Nameless One, god of evil - with imagery directly referencing the Great Seals that held the Dark One in place in the Wheel of Time:

> Consider the ancient symbol of the ying and yang, the circle contains both black and white, but within the white is a spot of black, and within the black a spot of white! Opposing forces, but each with a touch of the other within.

A ring of great power that dooms it's owner - Lord of the Rings:

> The ring that controlled the Talnoy had the unfortunate side effect of driving the wearer mad.

Amazon has at least 3 major problems with their bundled books arising from how they are bundled into a single "book" when delivered to Kindle. I'd recommend never buying a bundle since the process is a fair mess. This might just be because these books were written before ebook formatting and some automatic formatting did a poor job.

- The progress percentage of how much you've read is completely wrong. It's calculated over the total of all books in the bundle, not the individual book you're reading.
- It's very difficult to navigate across books, since they're organized into a single virutal book.
- The table of contents makes the second and third books look like chapters in the first.
