This book is approximately the definition of "fine". It has a little bit of Pug blasting an evil sorcerer, troubled youths getting into mischief, and beautiful medieval sewer exploration. But all of these things feel like the "light" version with surface level descriptions and a lot of jumping around. There's also a whole plot line with robots that goes nowhere (yet, although it's probably continued in the rest of the 3 book series).

Amazon has at least 3 major problems with their bundled books arising from how they are bundled into a single "book" when delivered to Kindle. I'd recommend never buying a bundle since the process is a fair mess. This might just be because these books were written before ebook formatting and some automatic formatting did a poor job.

- The progress percentage of how much you've read is completely wrong. It's calculated over the total of all books in the bundle, not the individual book you're reading.
- It's very difficult to navigate across books, since they're organized into a single virutal book.
- The table of contents makes the second and third books look like chapters in the first.
