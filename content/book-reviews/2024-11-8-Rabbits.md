Apparently, I'm a total sucker for VR puzzles and mysteries that spill over into the real world. _Rabbits_ captures the imagination in the same way as the beginnings of _Ready Player One_. This concept of a puzzle that starts online but escapes through the imagination of its players into real life is just mesmerizing.

_Rabbits_ kindly estabilshes itself as a work of fiction early on, by describing the hot popular girls (who the progatonist totally and definitely actually kissed once) browsing Usenet forums.

Unfortunately, almost none of the book contains any puzzles to be solved, quick thinking, or connecting the dots to go on an adventure. Instead, the middle 70% is just waffling about wether or not the protagonist should continue "playing" Rabbits, the fictional game. It's never really defined what "playing Rabbits" consists of, besides the fact that someone wins at the end of every game. For an entire novel to be based around something, this weird avoidance of defining the singular central theme pretty much ruins the book. Some people are playing, some people quit playing because it's too dangerous, but what exactly a player and observer are doing differently in their day-to-day lives is never discussed.

The majority of the book is also in violation of the "Don't sit around and wait for things to happen to you" principle. The protagonist starts and stops playing frequently, but in either case waits around for friends and acquaintances to come to him with new clues and ideas. Only at the end of the book does he find an unnatural trail of rocket and space themed clues that he chooses to follow and advance the storyline.
