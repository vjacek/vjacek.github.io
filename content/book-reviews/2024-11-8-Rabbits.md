Apparently, I'm a total sucker for VR puzzles and mysteries that spill over into the real world. _Rabbits_ captures the imagination in the same way as the beginnings of _Ready Player One_. This concept of a puzzle that starts online but escapes through the imagination of its players into real life is just mesmerizing.

_Rabbits_ kindly estabilshes itself as a work of fiction early on, by describing the hot popular girls (who the progatonist totally and definitely actually kissed once) browsing Usenet forums.
