This book builds on the consistent themes of Professor Newport's work - that in our new attention economy, your time is your most precious resource, and protecting it from digital distractions is exceedingly and increasingly difficult, because millions of the smartest mind-hours are devoted to depriving you of it for their own profit.

In defense of this onslaught, high-quality leisure undertaken solely for the satisifaction of it's completion provides a significant mental fortress. Solitude and itentional practice of using digital tools for a singular purpose further remove the mind from increasingly assumed-standard distractions.

Although repetative in the message at times, and feeling like it could easily be condensed into a few blog posts, the book is an enjoyable read - all the more so because reading the long version is itself a form of digital minimalism. I could feel myself attempt escape to the familarness of my phone while reading sections I deemed repetative, but the very first lesson is therefore self-contained.

> When the void is filled, you no longer need distractions to help you avoid it.

> If your life consists only of actions whose "worth depends on the existence of problems, difficulties, needs, which these activities aim to solve," you're vulnerable to the existential despair that blooms in response to the inevitable question, _Is this all there is to life?_
