The writing is fine. The storyline of the book is fine. What's not fine is Chris McCandless's lame vagabondry - a series of poorly-at-best thought through decisions can be defended only by the ambiguous "call of the wild". Despite several starting advantages in life, McCandless decides to spend his life on the road for no reason other than a desire for "freedom" that only he can understand yet cannot express or communicate to others. This life on the road is then poorly executed; McCandless apparently makes no attempt to learn wilderness realities, craft, or survival techniques, either in theory or practice. This is the story of a obnoxiously amateur self-annointed expert. While most of us do indeed self-annoint some amount of expertise during college before learning better, McCandless's carelessness removes his ability to learn from his mistakes.
