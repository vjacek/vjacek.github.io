This book is _weird_, in the great way that Neil Gaiman excells at. Thouroughly enjoyable, I read this over the course of two afternoons.

Elements of the simplicity and directness that quickly advance the story are strong positive influences that I'll use for myself in the future.

> "And he said that wasn't brave of him, doing that, just standing there and being stung," Coraline said to the cat. "It wasn't brave because he wasn't scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. _That_ was brave.

> "Because," she said, "when you're scared but you still do it anyway, _that's_ brave."
