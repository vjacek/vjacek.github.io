title: "2024 Superlatives"
date: 2025-01-17

In 2024, I read 20 books, an increase from the 14 I read in 2023. Giving out superlatives last year and ranking my favorites was rather fun, so although I don't have a photo of all the physical books because I read many on kindle, here's the new ranked list -

Tress of the Emerald Sea  
Nightfall  
Ghost Town Living  
Neverwhere  
Slow Productivity  
Atomic Habits  
The Ride of a Lifetime  
Krondor Assassins  
Krondor Tear of the Gods  
Krondor Betrayal  
Jimmy and the Crawler  
Mona Lisa Overdrive

--- Highly Recommended Above ---

Jesuit Guide to Almost Everything  
The Ocean at the End of the Lane  
Frugal Wizard's Handbook to Surviging Medieval England

--- Don't Bother Below ---

Holy Moments  
The Software Developer's Career Handbook  
Rabbits  
The Princess Spy  
Three Body Problem

The major success this year is how far _down_ the list I was able to move the Highly Recommended Line, although the Don't Bother Line is troublingly high. I successfully Did-Not-Finished one book, but should have quit on 2 more. I believe there are more great books in the world than I'll ever be able to read, so terrible books should be quit as soon as possible.

Fiction: 13/20 (65%)  
Non-Fiction: 7/20 (35%)

**Book of the Year**  
_Tress of the Emerald Sea_  
Smart, clever, fast, and even experimental at times, _Tress_ is literary excellence in many dimensions.

**Best Series**  
_Krondor_  
Just go read everything Krondor you can possibly get your hands on, every one is solid and fun.

**Biggest Hype**  
_Atomic Habits_  
I'm very glad to have finally read _Atomic Habits_ but I also didn't find it as entirely lifechanging as it's sales numbers would suggest. Hopefully, this means that I have less to learn because I've already implemented most of it, but as always there are meaningful things to learn.

**Most Thought-Provoking**  
_Slow Productivity_  
The core themes of this book are very simple, but represent a challenge to the reader in their implementation. Actually getting your life to look like you want is of course difficult, but with a good frame for _why_, becomes a more approachable challenge.

**Most Difficult Read**  
_Mona Lisa Overdrive_  
Gibson's overly psychadelic writing really slows this book down as many passages take several re-reads to actually comprehend, but the world that eventually gets built in your imagination is quite good.

**Most Disappointing**  
_Rabbits_  
I love the genre, but _Rabbits_ is just such a terrible example of it.

**Worst of the Year**  
_Three Body Problem_  
Factually wrong in many ways, with writing that is simply boring and uninteresting. I unfortunately finished it because it "won" a Hugo award, but also awarded my first 0-star review.
