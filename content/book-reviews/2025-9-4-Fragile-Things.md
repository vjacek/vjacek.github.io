DID NOT FINISH

Well that was unfortunate, I guess I understand why Neil got himself canceled now. I found book to be marginally better than doomscrolling your phone while riding the commuter rail out of Boston at 5pm on a Thursday.

Many of the stories are stories about telling stories. This _could_ be pretty interesting, the meta-stories were mostly pretty good, but the internal stories were mostly pretty lousy. They didn't have purposes, meanings, or in many cases resolutions. One particular meta-story laments the problem of not having a story-shaped story to tell. That turns out to be indeed quite the problem.
