I've been practicing Stoicism for just a few years now, and probably like many, I've heard the top quotes from the top Stoics: Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus. But at some point in practice, one desires to learn more breadth of the history and enriched depths of characters that created it. _Lives of the Stoics_ serves that purpose wonderfully - it gives a roughly chronological overview of the main Stoic thinkers, their particular focuses within the philosophy, and examples of how they lived it in their lives. This is a great example of why secondary sources can indeed be useful.

Rather than list all the excellent quotes and re-discuss them, I'll simply encourage anyone to go read the book, and leave it to Musonius Rufus to summariz the wonderful freedom from burdens that Stoic thought can bring:

> There is no reason to choose a heavier misfortune if we can make do with the one in front of us.
