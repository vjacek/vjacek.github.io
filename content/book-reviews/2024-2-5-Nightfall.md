Isaac Asimov

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;

One of the most impressive aspects of Asimov's writing is that it can change your worldview in just a few pages of a short story. When the twist at the end makes you rethink how the universe works, the writing comes alive off the page.

The Nightfall anthology is great for 2 reasons. It covers a huge range of topics, styles, and story sizes. It also features a quick message from Asimov himself before each story, with his perspective on writing that story.

Read more Sci-Fi, it's awesome! (and engages your brain)
