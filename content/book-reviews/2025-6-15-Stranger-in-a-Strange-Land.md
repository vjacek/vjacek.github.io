This book starts as a fascinating exploration of how a human raised on Mars would have trouble adjusting to life among Earthlings, takes a hairpin turn into the construction of a utopian free-love cult, and yet still triumphantly manages to leave you thinking for days and days after finishing the last page.

The very best sci-fi leaves you in this pondering state across your daily life. In the case of _The Deep Range_, you _can't_ yet disprove the theory that keeps you thinking. In the case of _Stranger in a Strange Land_, I believe I can. The offered premise is that anything that groks is itself God. Therefore bugs, animals, and all people are God. But if we are to grok that grok is a level of understanding so perfect as to merge your thoughts with that which you grok, I argue that bugs, animals, and many people are actually incapable of that. Those lower lifeforms respond to stimuli, preserve and reproduce themselves, but have no ability to plan for the future and modify their environment in a way that optimizes their enjoyment or self-actualization. That seems like a decent discrimination between grokking and non-grokking lifeforms.

Agreeing or disagreeing with such a thought-provoking idea has no bearing on my total enjoyment of the book.

Jubal Harshaw is one of my favorite characters in fiction - he's smart, witty, forces others to follow logic, and has an ego perfectly tempered by that same force of logic.

Most wonderfully, Jubal contributes several entries to my personal Insults Hall of Fame:

> It's not nonsense and nobody asked you. You're not competent to have an opinion.

> Ignorant to six decimal places.

> Suitable for enriching lawns.

A few other excellent quotes:

> Most neuroses and some psychoses can be traced to the unnecessary and unhealthy habit of daily wallowing in the troubles and sins of five billion strangers.

Seems like at his core, Jubal is a Stoic. Although he may come off as egregiously self-centered, I don't think it's possible for a man of true logic be anything else.

> The importance of a personage could be told by the layers of flappers cutting him off from the mob. They were known as executive assistants, private secretaries, secretaries to private secretaries, press secretaries, receptionists, appointment clerks, et cetera - but all were "flappers" as each held arbitrary veto over communication from the outside.

The less a person has to deal with the proletariat "mob", the better. But in cutting ourselves off from everyone, we run the danger of cutting ourselves off from neighbors, friends, and useful companions. As third places evaporate to corporate greed by providing just enough flapping for the lowest to feel like the highest in the pecking order of consumerism, we are probably worse off.

As Jubal himself is acting as a flapper for the Man from Mars, he drops a fantastic line to confuse someone by using an incredibly complex word to call himself a simple bloviator:

> But you know, or should know, that I am a senior philosophunculist on active duty.

Philosophunculist: A minor or insignificant philosopher; someone who claims philosophical expertise that they do not possess.

In trying to reason about the existence of God, or the need for religion, a Jubal delivers a wonderful monologue, the kind of thing that sci-fi excels at, that keeps you thinking. In part:

> The universe was a silly place at best... But the least likely explanation for it was the no-explanation of random chance... Random chance was not a sufficient explanation of the universe - random chance was not sufficient to explain random chance; the pot could not hold itself.

This resonates incredibly well with me, [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager), and Werner Heisenberg, who said:

“The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”

Jubal gives an exquisitely succinct summary of the core problem with democracy:

> Democracy is a poor system; the only thing that can be said for it is that it's eight times as good as any other method. It's worst fault is that it's leaders reflect their consituients - a low level, but what can you expect?

Jubal on art:

> One does have to learn to look at art. But it's up to the artist to use language that can be understood. Most of these jokers don't _want_ to use language you and I could learn, they would rather sneer because we 'fail' to see what they are driving at. If anything. Obscurity is the refuge of the incompetent.

One time Lucy and I decided to explore the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. After being significantly underwhelmed for the better part of an hour, we walked into a well-lit but stark white room whose sole exhibits were a pile of trash on the floor, and a 10-foot roll of lime green vinyl hung from the ceiling. Having finally had enough of their pretending at "art", I reflexively said "fuck this" in not at all hushed museum tones, right in front of a docent. It was certainly an _exhibit_. We left the ICA, located the [Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mfa.org/), which happens to be on the other side of the city, and I spent $200 buying Lucy appropriate footware for the distance so that we could attend a Real Museum.

Jubal again on sound reasoning:

> ... to understand this, you must start by conceding their sincerity. ...You start by assuming that the must be wrong, judging them by the very code you reject. Try logic instead.
