I read 17 books this year.

Fiction: 10/17 (59%)
Non-Fiction: 7/17 (41%)

Three years ago I did something small. I wrote my first "book review" about [Commander Hadfield's](https://www.instagram.com/colchrishadfield/) _Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth_. This was one small step for blogs, but a giant leap for how I organize my projects. Since then, I've read 62 books and written at least a few short notes about them all. I've built [1headline](https://1headline.com) and [Victor Jacek Photography](https://victorjacekphotography.com) and used this blog as a homepage of sorts. I've written 15 "articles", and have plans for a book that I think I can actually achieve.

Small steps over time can become something really significant.

Which brings us to this year's rankings:

Excellent:

- Starship Troopers
- Yumi and the Nightmare Painter
- Stranger in a Strange Land
- Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman
- The Peace War

Good:

- Be Useful
- Every Tool a Hammer
- Lives of the Stoics

OK:

- Origins of the Wheel of Time
- Flight of the Nighthawks
- The Organized Mind
- Solaris

Did Not Finish:

- The Art of Invisibility
- Fragile Things
- Altered Carbon
- A Fire Upon the Deep

Appalingly Stupid:

- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

Starting with the good - The "Excellent" category was actually very difficult to rank between this year. Most of them are fiction, with 2 top spots from Robert A. Heinlein that really grew my perspective on the world. I'd definitely recommend everything in Excellent and Good.

Book of the Year: _Yumi and the Nightmare Painter_
Although I ultimately ranked it #2, _Yumi_ is such an interesting kind of book that it gets the top superlative. This was one of Sanderson's COVID projects, and is so noteworthy because it manages to be both a fictional escape and highly personal mental health support. It's approachable, conversational, and informal. But also very mind-enriching.

Most Thought-Provoking: _Starship Troopers_ and _Stranger in a Strange Land_
As I expand my classic Sci Fi reading beyond Asimov and Clark, Heinlein is easily another giant of Sci Fi thought and storytelling. In a year of divisive and disappointing politics in the United States, his observations about the failures of democaracy are more important than ever.

Weirdest: _Solaris_
This book tried to hit on many different concepts, but mostly failed to deliver on making any of them very interesting. It certainly did deliver on concepts that were annoying in how little sense they made.

Most Difficult Read: _The Organized Mind_
I've learned that there are 2 distinct types of books; those you can read in bed at night, and those you cannot. This book is interesting, but so densly academic that it's 100% in the fully-awake-attention-required category.

Biggest Surprise: _Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman_
I've known Feynman's name for a long time as one of the contributors to the Manhattan Project, but reading his autobiographical stories gives an incredibly rich and interesting view of the quirky, funny, and extremely sharp person behind the mathematical and physics theories. This book was a fantastic beach read.

DNF Count: 4
I'm very happy to report a record high 4 DNFs where I successfully stopped wasting time and energy reading awful books. This made the year in reading fairly frustrating though, as it was frequently punctured by books I grappled with trying to enjoy before quitting. If I count these as "read", 17 books seems like a respectable number. Without them, only 13 books in a year is not impressive. The paradox is that you _should_ DNF bad books as soon as possible, but the more books you DNF, the more disjointed your reading becomes.

Worst Book Ever: _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_
I had heard amazing things about this book, from a huge variety of sources, so I was incredibly excited to finally find and read _Zen_. I took way more notes than I usually do while reading because I was always hopeful of finding some hidden gems. In the end, it's entirely garbage - there's 1 salient philosophical point, and a pathetic 2 motorcycle facts. I'm still annoyed that I didn't learn anything about motorcycles. The impressive thing about this book is that I can confidently say it's the worst book I've ever read.

The silver lining is that _Zen_ helped me coalesce the idea for the book I want to write. I'm going to write the book this should have been, but of course in a software and engineering focused twist.
