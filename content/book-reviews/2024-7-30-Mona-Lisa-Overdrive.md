William Gibson

The only lucid page of this book is the last, where Gibson somehow pulls an amazing Asimov Twist from the wreckage of a great many useless characters, their useless locations, and nonexistent relationships. Of the 2 stars here, 1 of them is awarded to my own imagination for coming up with an amazing world that is sort of written about in the book.

There's no discernable purpose to any of the 4 completely separate and disjointed storylines, none of which have any sort of climax or resolution, just a bunch of things that happen. Goes on too long with no tightening of threads.

To give the most generous interpretation possible, that might be the entire point of the book - a nihilistic view that none of anything matters in light of the mega revelation on the last page.

There are some cool ideas in the book, but the book is hardly _about_ them, or based around them. The idea of plugging into the Matrix, a cyberspace (another Gibson-invented word) that feels as real as real life. Driving a robot or mech - approaching commonplace today, but groundbreaking in the 80s. Metaphors or similies that don't compare but just _are_. And Gibson's signature skips-the-fist-half-of-the-sentence direct imperative descriptions.

Most of the writing was far too psychedelic to be able to start forming opinions of characters, but for a few fleeting moments of sobriety Mona Lisa became understandable in a very sad or pitiful way.

Wikipedia's entry on Gibson will tell you that he ran away to Cananda to do drugs; _Mona Lisa Overdrive_ tells you how many drugs he did. I think it was pretty much all of them. I've read so much Gibson, but have found _Neuromancer_ to be a singluar beacon of incredible literary insight in a sky the color of a TV tuned to a dead channel.
