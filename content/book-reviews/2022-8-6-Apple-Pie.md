As I sit down to write this, logging into Goodreads with a Facebook account hasn't worked for 12 days. That seems like a fairly insane timeframe for an outage of this magnitude. But it also shows something else important. Amazon doesn't care about Goodreads. Although that's probably been obvious to the site's users for some time, this puts a number on how low the priority stack ranking goes. After all, what percetage of Amazon's business is books anymore?

The problem is that I _do_ care about reading, so if Amazon doesn't care about Goodreads, then neither care about me. Which is true, book readers are no significant source of revenue for them. This does however provide the inspiration for a long-desired activity, writing. Finding new books to read is easy, so I don't need any pretend-AI/ML suggestions, I'll own my own data, and it's certainly a double-edged sword, but nobody but my own effort can stop supporting this platform.

Most of the mental re-hydration required to set up a blog is easy. The steps required are themselves few and simple, and I've even left myself good notes. But the perennial problem of owning your own entire tech stack quickly arises...
