The protagonist of this book is a bystander to the story, and to a minor character's conflict. She does nothing to advance the story, and barely participates in it. This is either one of the greatest examples of "being nothing but a pawn in a game for higher beings", or a very disjointed way of telling a story; I'm very much not sure which is true. The dystopian futurism feels at times ominously achievable, and at others, narrowly focused on insignificant themes. The last two chapters feel tacked on in order to berate the reader with two of the extrordinarily few salient and moral points. The ending where everything works out perfectly is supremely boring, and doesn't match the dystopian setting of the rest of the story.
