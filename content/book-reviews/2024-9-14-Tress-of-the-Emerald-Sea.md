_Tress_ is easily one of Sanderson's best books, only _Mistborn_ is in the same category. It combines a smart hero who learns and grows along the way with a fantastically new magic system (only 1/3 of which gets explored, sequals here we come!), incredibly witty dialogue, and a storyline that never feels slow or stale.

One of the main strengths of _Tress_ the excellent characters and their dialogue; it's realistic, snarky, and witty in the style of Good Omens, which Sanderson actually mentions as an inspiration in the author's notes at the end of the book. But Tress was _better_.

The ending got me twice! At first I was furious that the whole journey was for nothing, then two pages later I was thrilled to be wrong! I didn't see either of those surprises coming either - many times the setups for twists are suspicious for a few pages before the twist drops, but the immersiveness of the story makes these twists feel very natural.

The only unfortuante irony (a word which you will learn more about in the book) is that we spend the least time with the best books. Great books pull us into commitment with the story and characters; we launch ourselves headlong into their world, and we've completed the hero's journey just in time to come up for air.
