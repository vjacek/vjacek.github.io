You could equally hand this book to a new reader of high fantasy or to a longtime fan of the genre and the Riftwar, and they would both be impressed and excited throughout the length of the story. Focusing on Prince Arutha's sons journey to Kesh and their own maturity, Jimmy the Hand takes a significant supporting role as mentor and conspirator of Arutha's stunning last-page twist. Through the Riftwar so far, we've never had much first-person insight into Arutha's mind, but this cliffjump implies so much for the reader to think about once the printed words are finished.

Without explicitly stating it, there are single sentences clearly identifiable as important points in the story: _Meet the Heros_, _The Challenge_, _The Twist_. Each requires setup, but the springing of the trap is exhillarating and propels the reader forwards. To me, this is the very definition of excellent writing, and I'd like to emulate it myself.
