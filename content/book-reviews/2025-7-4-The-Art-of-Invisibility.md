I bought this book without thinking or even skimming a few pages because Mitnick's first book _The Art of Deception_ was one of the first life-changing books I had ever read. It detailed the fascinating stories of hackers who used social engineering to gain access to people, places, and things that they shouldn't have. _The Art of Invisibility_ unfortunately couldn't be more different.

At best, this book achieves a high-level survey of how you might attempt to become digitally invisble (hint: it's nearly impossible, and you probably can't). This is accomplished by going into details of finding specific things in phone menus, app-specific settings, and walking the reader through using `ipconfig` in paragraph form. Blah.

I think there's an incredibly thin slice of the population who is tech-illeterate enough to not find these settings on their own, but also tech-savvy enough to take a few correct ations based on the advice.

Maybe they just need to know how much privacy they've given up, but in that case I'd love to hear the _stories_ of it becoming a problem, not the small ever-changing details of how to slightly mitigate it. And what are we supposed to do with the information? Give up all modern conveniences? And why? There's a huge difference between constant posting on social media about the sordid details of your misadventures vs using a few select digital tools to share curated content with friends and family. My major takeaway from the book is that it's so difficult to 100% completely hide ourselves in the digital age that it's not really worth trying. The cost doesn't outweigh the reward.

It's also a great example of a "time-capsule book" - written in 2017, it's awestruck by bitcoin being worth $618. While I have distinct memories of talking to coworkers about how rediculous it is that BTC could be at $4000 just a few months later. Hopefully my greatest finacial folly will be not buying as many BTC as I possibly could when I heard about it in the summer of 2010 (~$6), instead of just attempting to mine it for a few days before giving up because even then a solo CPU was already irrelevant.
