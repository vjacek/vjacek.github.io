When I read nonfiction, instead of taking notes in the moment, I take a picture of the salient passage and transcribe them later. The stories Commander Hadfield shares are incredibly interesting and well told, but the sheer number of pithy lessons that I found myself returning to undoubtedly rank this book very highly.

On Preparation:

> In my experience, fear comes from not knowing what to expect and not feeling you have any control over what's about to happen. When you feel helpless, you're far more afraid than you would be if you knew the facts. If you're not sure what to be alarmed about, everything is alarming.

> Preparation is not ony about managing external risks, but about limiting the liklihood that you'll unwittingly add to them.

> Anticipating problems and figuring out how to solve them is actually the opposite of worrying: it's productive. Likewise, coming up with a plan of action isn't a waste of time if it gives you peace of mind. While it's true that you may wind up being ready for something that never happens, if the stakes are at all high, it's worth it.

> A lot of people talk about expecting the best but preparing for the worst, but I think that's a seductively misleading concept. There's never just one "worst". Almost always there's a whole spectrum of bad possibilities. The only thing that would really qualify as _the_ worst would be not having a plan for how to cope.

> Sometimes a sim is a proving ground where you demonstrate how well rounded your capabilities are, but more often, it's a crucible where you identify gaps in your knowledge and encouter domino effects that simply never occured to you before.

> ... take your simulation seriously and engage as fully as you would in real life - but be prepared that the sim itself may be wrong.

> Forward planning was an easy way to show the people who made it possible for me to do my job that I didn't take them for granted. Making a flowery toast afterward, thanking your nearest and dearest for all their support, just won't cut it if, again and again, you've passed up opportunities to show appreciation in real time.

Humility and Relationships:

> If you start thinking that only your biggest and shiniest moments count, you're setting yourself up to feel like a failure most of the time. Personally, I'd rather feel good most of the time, so to me everything counts: the small moments, the medium ones, the successes that make the papers and also the ones that no one knows about but me. The challenge is avoiding being derailed by the big, shiny moments that turn other people's heads. You have to figure out for yourself how to enjoy and celebrate them, and then move on.

> It was also a big part of what made him a plus one on our crew. Not only did he bring a wealth of experience and knowledge, but he conducted himself as though no task was beneath him. He acted as though he considered himself a zero: reasonably competent but no better than anybody else. That made a lasting impression on me. Especially when I'm entering a new situation and don't yet have the lay of the land, I think about how to aim to be a zero and try to contribute in small ways without creating disruptions.

> My point though, is that saying thank you every once in a while just isn't enough when you're demanding that other people make real sacrifices so you can pursue your goals. It's not only the fun showy things like vacations that get the message across. You also have to be willing to do what you can to create the conditions that allow your partner the freedom to focus single-mindedly at times.
