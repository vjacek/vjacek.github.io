The best part of this book is the character building. I know the characters of _Return to Krondor_ well, and this gives deeper backstory and color to all of them, and others. Jimmy the Hand's quick thinking and cleverness stars in both game and books, but we also get first hand stories of Arutha's wisdom both in battle and court. We meet William for the first time and get to know a young soldier learning his place and forming his viewpoint. Captain Treggar, who could easily have been a throwaway character, gives a smart and practical example of managing yourself in relation to others.

And for anyone who has played _Return to Krondor_, this book is where we first meet Talia in happier times. Which somehow manages to make her story even more heartbreaking.
