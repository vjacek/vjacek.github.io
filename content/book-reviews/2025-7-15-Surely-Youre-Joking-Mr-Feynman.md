Frequently hilarious and sharply insightful, Feynman's autobiography is wonderful reading all the way through. They way he approaches problems of both personal and technical natures is one that more people should emulate. Fenyman's constant curiosity, along with a penchant for trouble, are the golden threads weaving throughout his life, again in both personal and technical realms.

This theme of curiosity and desire to explore new fields is something I really enjoy emulating - for all his scientific and mental prowress, Feynman was perfectly happy to walk into a room as the person knowing the least and ask questions, poke and prod the subect, until he actually _understood_ it; grokked it, in the true definition of the word. In this same way, I've learned that I love learning.

The development of the atomic bomb is a fascinating point in history for everyone, but especially for the scientist. Scientists, physicists, and engineers are the heroes of that story, and they are heroic not for their ability to fight dragons, negotiate, network, or land the sale. But for their ability to understand the world and _think_ about it in rare ways, then put those thoughts into practice in order to effect change on the physical world. Feynman adventures at Los Alamos seem somewhat tangential to the main storyline there, but are fascinating. So much so that I've realized the Manhattan Project is my WWII.

Talking about his time working on the Manhattan Project, Feynman sums up computers nicely:

> Well, Mr. Frankel, who started the program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you _play_ with them. They are so wonderful.

This could not be more true and accurate to exactly the joy I find in computers, and the reason I love being a software engineer. Computers are the ultimate toy - they give the ability to change and modify anything digital with near instant feedback - and being able to understand software is exactly like the scene in _The Matrix_ where Cypher describes people as lines of code. You gain the ability to see _through_ the world; instead of the pretty chrome on top, you see the truth of how things actually _work_. And it's fun.

After winning the Nobel Prize and becoming somewhat famous, Feynman attempted to help select textbooks for elementary education. His findings exactly echo my own elementary and high school experiences - the textbooks were awful and the teaching methods were mostly thoughtless rote.

> They were teaching something they didn't understand, and which was, in fact, _useless_, at that time, for the child.

I'm a visual learner - math makes extrordinarily little sense in written down formulas until it can be applied geometrically. I had always heard some people call math "beautiful", but could never understand it until I saw the [Unit Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle) animation where a point on it's circumference describes a sine wave of 1 Hertz. This _instantly_ clicked for me and I was able to start looking for mathematical and logical beauty in many more places. Physics, Chemistry, Statistics, and Engineering classes in high school were wonderfully complex enough to actually need visual diagrams and representations of thier subject matter. In CompSci class, I applied visual learning to "invent" the [Sieve of Erathosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) after developing a fascination with prime numbers. It's some of the earliest computer code I ever wrote. My physics teacher took one look at how I was finding primes, and laughed that I had used a literally ancient algorithm, but was thrilled that I had come up with it independently. To his great credit, after the seniors graduated, my junior-year spring semester's task was to "build something cool", and that is _exactly_ how I learn best.
