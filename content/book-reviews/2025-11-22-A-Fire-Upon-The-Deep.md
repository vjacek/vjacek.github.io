DID NOT FINISH

This book was so incredibly dumb and boring that I had to go back to reading _Walden_. Which is an amazing book, but not exactly a Sci Fi thriller.

I hate books where the first "protagonist" is killed immediately. It's not clever or interesting or new. It's a let down to the reader and leaves them searching for a reason to care about anything in the book, since you've just shown that the first thing they tried to care about wasn't actually important. You're telling the reader "no you're wrong" right away instead of leading them on a journey of discovery.

There were a few cool things in the first hundred pages - vertically landing rocket ships imagined in 1992 that turned out to be commonplace today, the exploration of multi-person conciousness, and the vague idea that your level of intelligence can be determined by location in space.

This book attempts to do far too much while not developing any through-line of the story that is actually interesting. And concious bonsai trees riding skateboard-brains are just stupid.

The best thing about this book is that I've leared to not trust the Hugo awards at all anymore. I've been burned by _A Fire Upon the Deep_, _Three Body Problem_, and _The Left Hand of Darkness_.
