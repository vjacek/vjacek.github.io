Adam Savage

&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734;

One of the world's foremost builders, creatives, inventors, problem-solvers, or as he describes himself, Maker, Adam Savage is the right person to listen to when it comes to building stuff. He's done it. A lot of it. So this book holds incredible weight of informed opinion. Savage details a few successes and failures throughout the book's topics, those stories form an awesome backbone for exploring a great set of wide-ranging topics.

One of the major themes of the book is that Failure isn't failure, it's iteration. Which means you've learned something in the process and are better equipped for it next time, or for a different challenge that will happen next.

The simple list is a model for getting things done, correctly.

Glue is a metaphor for the ability to hold reversible decisions.

Drawers become a metaphor for mental clarity transformed into action.

Drawing is a superpower of communication.

Cardboard is the physical manifestation of the power of experimentation.

Obsession, curiosity, and sharing are expolored for the great mindsets that they are.
