Jimmy's signature cleverness is used to great effect both causing and getting out of trouble in a series of adventures, where the reader gets to know more inner workings of the Thieves Guild. A parallel storyline details events touched upon in the main Riftwar Saga. This is the main drawback of the book; Jimmy's adventures are second to none, yet half the book is spent following others.
