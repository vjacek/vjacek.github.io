Another great book starring Jimmy the Hand. I'm not sure anything can compare, for me, to spending the summer before 6th grade playing one of the earliest computer RPGs, and certainly the first 3D RPG I had played. But the book does a fair job of condensing an entire game into a shorter readtime than playtime.

The most interesting difference is the lack of immersion the book version provides. In a game where you're driving the story forwards, there's both real risk and reward associated with putting on armor that might be cursed or blessed, or a ring that might be poisioned. You might be able to identify a potion as Fire Oil and use it to great combat advantage, or you might need to risk drinking an unkown elixer hoping that it's a health potion. You might be disappointed when all the rubies you recover turn out to be fakes, and you might be frustrated when it's incredibly difficult to put the shipwrecker's wind puzzle back together before it fades away. Some of those same experiences made it into the book's story, but only for the reader to be _told_ that Jazhara was frustrated at the locked puzzle; you don't take it personally the same way.
