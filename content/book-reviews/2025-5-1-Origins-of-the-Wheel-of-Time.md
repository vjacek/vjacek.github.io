I quite enjoyed the first third of this book, where we learn about Jordan's life, interests, and the stories and concepts that he pulled from to write The Wheel of Time. The second two thirds are just a glossary listing of people, places, and things. But only their linguistic derivation, not their significance to story or characters.

Learning a little about the linguistic derivations of names is fun, for example, Avalon becomes Tar Valon. Going super deep on those gets boring real fast. The problem is that while we learn 5 or 6 aliases for the name Lanfear, but don't get the explainition of _why_ Lanfear gets so many different names. I'm also simply not impressed or interested with early English mythology, from which so much naming is pulled.

High school was a wonderful time to read WoT, before there was too much symbolism required to be applied to the awesomeness of the magic, story, and characters.

Livingston also makes a few cases that I'm highly skeptical of:

Randland is Earth but in a different time. To me, this needs much more proof than a supposed Mercedes Benz symbol found in a chest of trinkets. It's a cool geometric symbol, not necessarily an Easter Egg. Like horn hunters, Easter egg hunters tend to find them everywhere they look.

He makes a point of saying that Jordan tried to include infinite inclusiveness, and simply ran out of time to complete the task. This feels like the analyzer trying to put themes in the authors mouth and fit everything to them. Sometimes particular worldviews simply make for a good story and don't have to be apologized for.

Absolutely everything has to relate to Vietnam. Jordan explained in interviews that it obviously colors his view of the world, but increasing claims by the analyzer about it's specific influence must be met with increasing skepticism.
