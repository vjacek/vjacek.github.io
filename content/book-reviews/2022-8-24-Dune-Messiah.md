Nothing really happens in this entire book. Paul Maud'Dib antagonizes himself with the ability to see the future, yet somehow do nothing about his own predestination. Instead of a storyline, the book skips around to follow the fleeting thoughts of several characters and their current feelings towards one another; the definition of a Space Opera, in the worst way. The conflict is stated instead of shown, and the fascinating future-historic technology of _Dune_ is almost entirely missing. Existing in the same universe as the excellent _Dune_ entirely fails to be a redeeming quality of this sequel.
