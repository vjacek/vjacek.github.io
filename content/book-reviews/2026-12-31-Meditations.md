Marcus Aurelius

_Meditations_ receives no stars because to me it exists outside the normal scoring system I can use for books. If you're careful enough to remain open and observant, life changing wisdom will cross your path at least a handful of times in life. This is one such intersection.

The belt system of ranks in karate holds an incredible lesson: Although there is a wide range of experience and expertise levels, everyone remains a student forever.

The hard part of becoming a student of Stoic philosophy is that every single situation, in every single day, calls you to practice. Because the tool is your own mind, there is no way to skip gym day; by holding knowledge you are compelled by Nature to use it. Fortunately, this compulsion also makes it easy, because the very same compulsion grants you experience through action, and the opportunity to improve.
