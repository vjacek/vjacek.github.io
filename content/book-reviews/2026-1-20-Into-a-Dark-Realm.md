This book is a solid fun read in itself, but is most interesting because it fixes all of the problems present in _Flight of the Nighthawks_. It's like Feist looked critically at _Nighthawks_ and really put in the effort to make _Realm_ a better book. Instead of focusing on the boring kids with no magic abilities, the story returns to master Pug's adventures through the Hall of Worlds and beyond. We get another rare glimpse of Honest John's, the tavern inside the Hall of Worlds owned by the only being with the potential to rival Macros the Black in power. Speaking of Macros, he's the twist, and a wonderful one.

I also can't help but think that Feist liked the character of Jimmy the Hand so much that he tried to write him a second time as Jommy. Unfortunately it didn't work, and spoiler alert, we get a 3rd attempt as Jim Dasher aka JimmyHand in the final book of the Darkwar Saga. None will ever rival Jimmy the Hand, so the lesson here is that greatness is usually best left to stand on it's own instead of repeated.

> Pug said, “I often wonder at these small coincidences in life: that something that appears nothing more than a chance, but in the end turns out to be vital.”
