### The Wise Man's Fear

Patrick Rothfuss

&#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;

As I read Fantasy and Sci-Fi books, I like to take note of particular writing methods and distill them into themes that can be harnessed when doing my own writing. These themes of course can be split into "emulate" and "avoid". _The Wise Man's Fear_ is gracious enough to provide one of each.

_In-Universe Complex Context Reload_

Starting off with the "emulate" column, as a sequal, this book is responsible for bringing you back into Kvothe's world of the Four Corners. In particular, the magic system of `sympathy` requires a bit of context loading for the reader. This is accomplished very smoothly, and better yet, inside the story itself through character discussion. I'm proud of realizing this is what was going on during that scene, since it felt entirely natural and contrived to fit the purpose. This is in contrast to _The Lost Metal_ which has another relatively complex magic system, but neglects to refresh the user on the mechanics of how it works. You're thrust directly into using the magic, without any refresher on the particulars. This might work better for a faster-paced medium like TV where you're likely to watch several episodes or even the whole series in quick succession. But in books, where even at Brandon-Sanderson-pace it's likely for sequals to be released with years between, gentle reminders of complex systems seems to work very well.

_No Wild Goose Chases_

If the characters in your story are getting bored and tired of the mission they are on, you can be absolutely sure that the reader is even more bored, and most likely completely sick of it. No travelling from place to place looking for so-and-so, no talking to random one-off characters for scraps of information that the reader could likely guess, and no search-and-rescue style sweeps of empty forest. Maybe you could set those expectations up, but then the better choice would be to shatter them with some event of interest. At another point in the story, the here specifically describes how several events were so boring that he now skips over the retelling of them. So I know it's possible to excise these low points from the story as a whole; leaving the Wild Goose Chase in the story is a fault.

There is a shift in tone in this book from it's predecessor. The hero transitions from an unlikely hero with the deck stacked against him, to a self-sure hero overconfident in several dimensions. And at 16 years old, it's not so much believability that is getting stretched as the reader's positive perception of the hero.

This makes me appreciate Rand's journey in _The Wheel of Time_ - even at the very end of the series where he is massively powerful and has proved it many times, it feels entirely possible for him to fail. This uncertainty is what propels a story with the reader's interest.

One of the best things about recording my thoughts in real time as I progress through a book is that I get to edit previous ideas based on what I learn in the rest of the book. In this case, I need to edit my new rule _No Wild Goose Chases_ to be _No Wild Goose Chases or Sits_. A huge portion of the middle of this book consists of the hero waiting around for things to happen. Waiting for the perfect time to escape the fairy realm, waiting to tell your soulmate the truth of your feelings, or waiting around to be deemed "ready" to be tested as a Aiel mercenary. Oh wait, I mean Adem.

_No Copying Huge Parts of Other Stories_

Supposedly, Rothfuss never read the Wheel of Time and invented the Adem entirely on his own. I find this exceptionally difficult to believe. The Adem seem like a straight copy of the Aiel; a warrior people with a unique code of honor pushed to live on marginal land where the hero spends an extended time training in their martial arts and wisdom. The Adem also use their hands to talk, just like the Aiel Spearmaidens, but unline the Aiel, all Adem use hand talk all the time. For a book whose magic system was so concerned with scientific plausibility, this makes no sense. Human anatomy is such that we have many muscles in our faces, making them very good at rendering a great many different expressions within a small area. Purposely avoiding facial expression negates all that, for no other benefit.

To further the point, the "Three Silences" opening and closing feels like a discount "A Wind Rose...", something entirely separate from the Adem/Aiel.
