<p>Chris Kyle<br>
★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>Some subjects are always worth learning about, even if they&rsquo;re not personally interesting, generally interesting, or have any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  These subjects demand at least some attention from any learned mind, even if the only lessons are in their awfulness, responsibility, or consequences.  A few books about the Holocaust come to mind, especially <em>Night</em> by Eli Wiesel.  There is nothing good about the subject, but learning and understanding it teaches the reader about an awful part of the world so that we may understand and avoid it.</p>
<p>The best that can be said for American Sniper is that it fits into this same category of books.  Kyle illustrates this by showing the worst of the American military in a good light, which redoubles the negativity.</p>
<p>Kyle shows himself to be an ignorant thug, an absentee father, and useless husband.  He seems to think that winning a bar fight proves inherent superiority, and that losing a bar fight which lands him in jail, then getting bailed out because he&rsquo;s on a Navy SEAL team, also proves inherent superiority.  Being above the law, and above morality, seems to be a hallmark of SEAL indoctrination.  On page 360, Kyle again repeats his pretend mantra about being a &ldquo;silent professional&rdquo; (nevermind the bar fights), and on page 361, he throws a temper tantrum about not getting enough credit for shooting lots of bad guys.</p>
<p>Kyle is very very good at shooting bad guys, he shot lots of them, and most of the ones he shot, he killed too.  He liked shooting bad guys very much.  On account of how they were the bad guys.  Kyle was the best of the good guys, and that&rsquo;s why he shot so many bad guys.  Other good guys shot some bad guys, but none shot as many bad guys as Kyle did.  Mr. Silent Professional was very good at his job, which was shooting bad guys, and that makes him righteous and correct about everything.</p>
