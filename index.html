This book took me probably 6 months to finish. I picked it up several times, but struggled to find it interesting enough to finish and frequently moved on to a new book. I would have greatly preferred to simply read stories about Shetty&rsquo;s time in the ashram, and how he applies those lessons to modern life.
It sits at the intersection of productive self-improvement and philosophy, so ostensibly a very interesting subject.

This book really sucks. Mostly for the completely wasted opportunities of fairly good ideas. A world too cold for insects and animals larger than a dog to survive, yet with still active volcanic zones. People who are both genders. Explorers from worlds light years away making contact with primitive humans and bringing them into a universal community. Actually, that last one had a documentary about it called Stargate.

I&rsquo;m going to start listening to any book that opens with &ldquo;You might not want to read this book.&rdquo; The problem is that I really did want to read this book, or at least the story that I thought it would be great if it contained. I wanted to read about how Auri came to be who she is and live where she does, and why her view of the world is shaped the way it is.

★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆
As I read Fantasy and Sci-Fi books, I like to take note of particular writing methods and distill them into themes that can be harnessed when doing my own writing. These themes of course can be split into &ldquo;emulate&rdquo; and &ldquo;avoid&rdquo;. The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear is gracious enough to provide one of each.
In-Universe Complex Context Reload
Starting off with the &ldquo;emulate&rdquo; column, as a sequal, this book is responsible for bringing you back into Kvothe&rsquo;s world of the Four Corners.

★ ★ ★ ★ ★
At almost 700 pages, this is far from the longest book I&rsquo;ve ever read, but I read it faster than some books 1/3 it&rsquo;s size. Perhaps an even greater compliment is the several times I stayed up hours late reading to finish the story.
The story itself is actually nothing all that earth-shattering: our hero is orphaned as a young boy, learns hard lessons on the street, finds himself clever enough to make it to the magical University, and then excells in lessons, while causing a fair amount of trouble.

  Good Omens Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett
★ ★ ★ ★ ★
I&rsquo;ve never been the antagonist of a book before, but it turns out to be pretty fun. When a logical argument can be made for the representatives of both Heaven and Hell to work together because the real problem is those pesky humans, the result is a golden story. The best part is that the relationship between an angel and demon turns out incredibly naturally, perhaps because they both borrow so much of their personalities from those same flawed humans.

  The Lost Metal Brandon Sanderson ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆
Reading this book strongly reinforces the importance of approaching a series in order, and ideally without interruption. In this case, I didn&rsquo;t, and the experience suffered for it. I had read the first book in the series, unknowingly skipped the second two, and picked up this book as the 4th because I knew I enjoyed the author and series. The problem is that significant plot points and items are discussed as if they are common knowledge, because to the characters they are, but I had to piece them together with very limited context clues.

This book is a fun, quick, and entertaining read, but the best part is that it&rsquo;s a techno-thriller that doesn&rsquo;t get anything wrong. Although this shouldn&rsquo;t be the accomplishment that it is, not getting any technical details wrong really is quite notable. I&rsquo;m constantly complaining that an author decided to include detail they didn&rsquo;t need to, and then got some part of that detail wrong.

  Besides world-class entertainment, immersive story-driven rides, and fine dining where you can eat filet mignon 3 times a day [1], the engineered efficiency of Disney World is absolutely top-tier. That makes it all the more fun to find situations that can be improved. Our most recent trip in August 2023 provided a few:
In order to enter the parks, you must scan either an RFID-based MagicBand(TM) which is like a digital watch without all the excitement, or an RFID-based card, which is like a Disney-branded RFID card.

I can&rsquo;t really figure out why this book was 600 pages long. There&rsquo;s not a huge amount of action, intrigue, and certainly not suspense. Oh, except that GRRM blurbed the cover and the proles think he&rsquo;s the only fiction author to ever exist, despite ample evidence that he&rsquo;s both a terrible and lazy writer.
Characters and places are described directly, but in the wrong sort of way.

  Why do we like overpacking for trips so much?
I think it&rsquo;s because the brain loves resets and new things - I think the brain actually loves getting good at new skills and environments much more than it enjoys being good at those same skills and in those same environments. The brain is near infinitely flexible and that&rsquo;s its ultimate strength.
I just finished packing for a single weekend away. I wanted to bring a journal and necessary fountain pen, writing prompt book, a new nonfiction book to read, handheld amateur radio, laptop, camera gear, and Nintendo Switch.

I somehow made it through the 90s without ever seeing Jurassic Park the movie, so when I found a paperback copy of Jurassic Park the book at the Northborough Library Book Sale, I figured this was my opportunity to do it the right way.
Read the book first, then watch the movie.

Some subjects are always worth learning about, even if they&rsquo;re not personally interesting, generally interesting, or have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. These subjects demand at least some attention from any learned mind, even if the only lessons are in their awfulness, responsibility, or consequences. A few books about the Holocaust come to mind, especially Night by Eli Wiesel. There is nothing good about the subject, but learning and understanding it teaches the reader about an awful part of the world so that we may understand and avoid it.

This book is classic Sci-Fi at it&rsquo;s best - a plucky protagonist with a few more smarts and skills than average takes on a new mission, a mission that he succeeds at in fact, until the pivotal brain-bending twist that forces you to step back and think &ldquo;What If?&rdquo;.
This &ldquo;What If?&rdquo; moment is my favorite thing about Sci-Fi, and to me, the facet that defines it.

I think I read this book incorrectly. I approached it in the usual manner; starting at the front, making progress one page at a time, until all pages have been turned in order. Progress was measured in groups of 10-20 pages, covering the stories of 2-5 individual colors at a time.
There are other valid methods however, and it seems a wise reminder to not automatically approach every scenario with only the exact techniques that have worked in the past.

  In a quote that I can neither exactly remember nor find, in which some terribly heretical 19th-century socialist extolls the absurdity of limiting a work day to 8 hours, they also comment on the remaining 8 hours of leisure, rest, and relaxation time that each man has available at the end of the workday, and before the biologically required 8 hours of sleep. The main point is that every man is free to conduct himself exactly like the wealthy for those 8 hours.

The Serpentwar Saga is off to an unfortunate start: we follow a mercenary company as they sail around for a bit, march here, march over there, march up those mountains, march back down the slightly easier other side of the mountain, march into a town, march out of a town, march into a meeting of companies, march away from the other companies, march through a strange magical tunnel that turns out to have absolutely no bearing on the story&hellip; There&rsquo;s a huge amount of adventuring around in order to learn the super secret important information, but when the mission is completed, we&rsquo;re not even included on what the secret info was.

You could equally hand this book to a new reader of high fantasy or to a longtime fan of the genre and the Riftwar, and they would both be impressed and excited throughout the length of the story. Focusing on Prince Arutha&rsquo;s sons journey to Kesh and their own maturity, Jimmy the Hand takes a significant supporting role as mentor and conspirator of Arutha&rsquo;s stunning last-page twist.

  As I sit down to write this, logging into Goodreads with a Facebook account hasn&rsquo;t worked for 12 days. That seems like a fairly insane timeframe for an outage of this magnitude. But it also shows something else important. Amazon doesn&rsquo;t care about Goodreads. Although that&rsquo;s probably been obvious to the site&rsquo;s users for some time, this puts a number on how low the priority stack ranking goes. After all, what percetage of Amazon&rsquo;s business is books anymore?

  I recently spent some time thinking about how nice it is to be able to pay for gas a with a phone app from inside the car, the get out and start pumping immediately, no card swiping or buttons besides the big 89 needed. And once you&rsquo;re done pumping, the app collects one single point of feeback data: you can click either the Smile, Meh, or Frown emoji.
Theoretically, something is being done with this data.

  In the past few years, Cumberland Farms has transformed themselves from a blue-and-orange gas station that you go to because you have to, into a blue-and-green (because you can reap the marketing rewards of the color green) gas station destination.
They did all this by changing the few things that people actually care about when it comes to gas stations. The stations now have a bright, modern design, with white walls and light wood floors.
