  <p>In 2024, I read 20 books, an increase from the 14 I read in 2023. Giving out superlatives last year and ranking my favorites was rather fun, so although I don&rsquo;t have a photo of all the physical books because I read many on kindle, here&rsquo;s the new list -</p>
<p>Tress of the Emerald Sea<br>
Nightfall<br>
Ghost Town Living<br>
Neverwhere<br>
Slow Productivity<br>
Atomic Habits<br>
The Ride of a Lifetime<br>
Krondor Assassins<br>
Krondor Tear of the Gods<br>
Krondor Betrayal<br>
Jimmy and the Crawler<br>
Mona Lisa Overdrive</p>
<p>&mdash; Highly Recommended Above &mdash;</p>
<p>Jesuit Guide to Almost Everything<br>
The Ocean at the End of the Lane<br>
Frugal Wizard&rsquo;s Handbook to Surviging Medieval England</p>
<p>&mdash; Don&rsquo;t Bother Below &mdash;</p>
<p>Holy Moments<br>
The Software Developer&rsquo;s Career Handbook<br>
Rabbits<br>
The Princess Spy<br>
Three Body Problem</p>
<p>The major success this year is how far <em>down</em> the list I was able to move the Highly Recommended Line, although the Don&rsquo;t Bother Line is troublingly high. I successfully Did-Not-Finished one book, but should have quit on 2 more. I believe there are more great books in the world than I&rsquo;ll ever be able to read, so terrible books should be quit as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fiction: 13/20 (65%)<br>
Non-Fiction: 7/20 (35%)</p>
<p><strong>Book of the Year</strong><br>
<em>Tress of the Emerald Sea</em><br>
Smart, clever, fast, and even experimental at times, <em>Tress</em> is literary excellence in many dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Best Series</strong><br>
<em>Krondor</em><br>
Just go read everything Krondor you can possibly get your hands on, every one is solid and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest Hype</strong><br>
<em>Atomic Habits</em><br>
I&rsquo;m very glad to have finally read <em>Atomic Habits</em> but I also didn&rsquo;t find it as entirely lifechanging as it&rsquo;s sales numbers would suggest. Hopefully, this means that I have less to learn because I&rsquo;ve already implemented most of it, but as always there are meaningful things to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Most Thought-Provoking</strong><br>
<em>Slow Productivity</em><br>
The core themes of this book are very simple, but represent a challenge to the reader in their implementation. Actually getting your life to look like you want is of course difficult, but with a good frame for <em>why</em>, becomes a more approachable challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Most Difficult Read</strong><br>
<em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em><br>
Gibson&rsquo;s overly psychadelic writing really slows this book down as many passages take several re-reads to actually comprehend, but the world that eventually gets built in your imagination is quite good.</p>
<p><strong>Most Disappointing</strong><br>
<em>Rabbits</em><br>
I love the genre, but <em>Rabbits</em> is just such a terrible example of it.</p>
<p><strong>Worst of the Year</strong><br>
<em>Three Body Problem</em><br>
Factually wrong in many ways, with writing that is simply boring and uninteresting. I unfortunately finished it because it &ldquo;won&rdquo; a Hugo award, but also awarded my first 0-star review.</p>
