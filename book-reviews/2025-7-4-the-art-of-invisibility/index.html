  <p>Kevin Mitnick</p>
<p>★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>DID NOT FINISH</p>
<p>I bought this book without thinking or even skimming a few pages because Mitnick&rsquo;s first book <em>The Art of Deception</em> was one of the first life-changing books I had ever read. It detailed the fascinating stories of hackers who used social engineering to gain access to people, places, and things that they shouldn&rsquo;t have. <em>The Art of Invisibility</em> unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t be more different.</p>
<p>At best, this book achieves a high-level survey of how you might attempt to become digitally invisble (hint: it&rsquo;s nearly impossible, and you probably can&rsquo;t). This is accomplished by going into details of finding specific things in phone menus, app-specific settings, and walking the reader through using <code>ipconfig</code> in paragraph form. Blah.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an incredibly thin slice of the population who is tech-illeterate enough to not find these settings on their own, but also tech-savvy enough to take a few correct ations based on the advice.</p>
<p>Maybe they just need to know how much privacy they&rsquo;ve given up, but in that case I&rsquo;d love to hear the <em>stories</em> of it becoming a problem, not the small ever-changing details of how to slightly mitigate it. And what are we supposed to do with the information? Give up all modern conveniences? And why? There&rsquo;s a huge difference between constant posting on social media about the sordid details of your misadventures vs using a few select digital tools to share curated content with friends and family. My major takeaway from the book is that it&rsquo;s so difficult to 100% completely hide ourselves in the digital age that it&rsquo;s not really worth trying. The cost doesn&rsquo;t outweigh the reward. The only truly anonymous way to interact with the internet (at least in the U.S.) would be to obtain cash that was not withdrawn from your own account, pay a hobo to buy you a burner phone while avoiding any cameras that could see you together, then using that phone from a location you never personally visit and without any of your regular technology present.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a great example of a &ldquo;time-capsule book&rdquo; - written in 2017, it&rsquo;s awestruck by bitcoin being worth $618. While I have distinct memories of talking to coworkers about how rediculous it is that BTC could be at $4000 just a few months later. Hopefully my greatest finacial folly will be not buying as many BTC as I possibly could when I heard about it in the summer of 2010 (~$6), instead of just attempting to mine it for a few days before giving up because even then a solo CPU was already irrelevant.</p>
<p>As a software engineer, I actively make sure that my work is <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/introduction/what-is-observability/">observable</a>, logs and traces are my friends. I can only assume that other smart engineers who build complex things need the same; although they might just need to get a PM off their back, the observability they build to get through the day could absolutely be mined to uncover any digital action you take.</p>
