  <p>Vernor Vinge</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p><em>The Peace War</em> is an absolute masterclass in classic Sci-Fi.</p>
<p>It starts with an unlikely hero, gives them a mentor and room to grow, puts them in increasing degrees of peril, and pulls the reader in with several twists that are just guessable enough that it compells you to keep reading faster and faster as you near the end. The characters and technology are grounded in enough science to make them very believeable, with the smallest suspension of disbelief required to understand the bobbles. The writing is direct but assumes a lot of the reader, requiring that you keep up with evolutions of in-world technology and strategy. This elevated requirement of mental agility is wonderful and makes you feel like your brain is working, not merely following along.</p>
<p>As I started reading more classic Sci-Fi, Asimov, Wells, Dick, and Clarke are often correctly cited as the giants of the genre. Even based on this one book that I&rsquo;ve read so far, Vinge deserves to be among that list as well. In researching his other works, I learned that he was a professor of math and computer science - this knowledge and understanding clearly makes an impressively positive difference in his writing vs others who cannot ground their fantasies in believability.</p>
<p><em>Halo</em> is one of the best video games of all time, in part because as you play the Master Chief character, you get the benefit of an AI symbiote who is both embedded in your own mind and able to function external to it. <em>The Peace War&rsquo;s</em> Jill is <em>exactly</em> the same, to the point that I can imagine Cortana being directly based on her. The fact that Vinge makes the AI symbiote work so well even in just printed paper instead of a completely immersive video game is a testament to his excellent writing.</p>
<p>In my review of <a href="https://vjacek.github.io/book-reviews/2022-9-3-enders-game/">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, I theorize that there is a limit to the number of invented terms that an author can use without breaking immersion, and that the limit is about 10 terms. I think <em>The Peace War</em> nails this exactly: bobbles, Peacers, Tinkers, the Aztlan and Jonques, biosciences, special battery cells that I can&rsquo;t remember the name of, comms and recon (clearly finding the idea of the Internet before it was actually widespread), gAu money, and the game Celeste. There&rsquo;s just enough new things to learn that they succeed in pulling you in without becoming overly disorienting.</p>
<p><em>The Peace War</em> is an easy finalist for best fiction I&rsquo;ll read in the year.</p>
