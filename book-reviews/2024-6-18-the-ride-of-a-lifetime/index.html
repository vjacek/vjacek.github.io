  <p>Robert Iger</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>This book is awesome because Iger talks about why things were hard, what he did to face the difficulties, and why those choices led to him being successful. He uses examples to color the ideas with story that draws you in, and neatly summarizes those ideas in ways that flow and teach. If you read this book through once and make an earnest attempt to learn anything from it, you&rsquo;ll be a dozen leadership steps ahead of a certain billionaire I worked for (2022-2024).</p>
<p>The wisdom of Iger&rsquo;s writing is that he gives very approachable and applicable lessons through telling stories about his life. His advice is through the lens of the story that he lived, and why he found each aspect important. This is the perfect example of &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; done correctly.</p>
<p>In one chapter (<em>It&rsquo;s about the future</em>), Iger details an interaction with a consultant who comes to prep him for consideration as the CEO by Disney&rsquo;s Board of Directors. The consultant asks some very basic questions which have a grounding effect; a take-stock moment that Iger thought he was already passed, but in reality he skipped. The lesson here is to check your assumptions, go back to the starting point, and form a strategy from 0, proving that you&rsquo;re doing it right as you go.</p>
<p>I also found an incredible humbleness in the story of Steve Jobs telling Iger that Jobs knew he had cancer, and only a short time to live. Jobs has always been known in the tech industry as ruthless, demanding, and as someone who can force progress. But this story showed that he also had an incredibly strong internal moral compass, and would do the right thing for those he respected. Another time, Jobs voted to remove some Disney Boardmembers, and Iger politically needed those votes changed. Jobs was willing to do it for Iger, but pulled no punches on his view of the Boardmembers, and gave only time to accomplish their removal, but never changed his opinion.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the Hero&rsquo;s story told through his own perspective. Iger appears to be a one-expertise kind of leader. If you have a successful company and want to get bought by Disney, he&rsquo;ll make it happen. If you are part of a struggling branch of Disney already and want to turn your line of business around, think again. You could expect Iger to bring in outsiders who do your job better than you who you&rsquo;ll be expected to follow.</p>
<p>Iger also glosses over the forced retirement of John Lasseter, who was one of the major reasons Disney bought Pixar. One can assume the allegations against Lasseter are true, because Iger simply buries the story with a &ldquo;high degree of confidentiality&rdquo;. Morals, and holding people to their responsibilities, appears to be absent if you are worth enough (in dollars or politically).</p>
<p>Iger could also have done better than a few pages of separation between his friendship and business alliances with Rupert Murdoch, and starting a chapter supposedly about personal values.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I would enjoy working for a company led by Robert Iger. He admit&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s wrong about people, forces a fair and balanced view of decisions, and gets things done. He has personal lessons and principles that he leads by, and if even half of the examples are true, it&rsquo;s clear he prioritizes the people who create success for the organizations he leads.</p>
