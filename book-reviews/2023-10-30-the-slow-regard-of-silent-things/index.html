<p>Patrick Rothfuss</p>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start listening to any book that opens with &ldquo;You might not want to read this book.&rdquo; The problem is that I really did want to read this book, or at least the story that I thought it would be great if it contained. I wanted to read about how Auri came to be who she is and live where she does, and why her view of the world is shaped the way it is.</p>
<p>The book is none of those things. THe most problematic reason is that there was zero storyline to this book, only 100% descriptions of small details in the present day. No character development whatsoever, just description. If a character does something, there needs to be a <code>because</code>. Not even immediately, but eventually, it&rsquo;s important to understand why they did something instead of the opposite. Otherwise, your characters are as flat as animals or machines, statically reacting to their environment.</p>
<p>This does have the side-effect of giving me the clearest insight into mental illness that I&rsquo;ve ever had. As someone who mostly tries as hard as possible to stay away from mental illness, the book does a good job of presenting such a warped view of the normal world in a way that makes warped seem normal. Rothfuss clearly has a gift for writing empathetic characters, but it&rsquo;s poorly harnessed here.</p>
