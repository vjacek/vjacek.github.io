  <h3 id="good-omens">Good Omens</h3>
<p>Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett<br>
★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been the antagonist of a book before, but it turns out to be pretty fun. When a logical argument can be made for the representatives of both Heaven and Hell to work together because the real problem is those pesky humans, the result is a golden story. The best part is that the relationship between an angel and demon turns out incredibly naturally, perhaps because they both borrow so much of their personalities from those same flawed humans.</p>
<p>The blurbs on the back cover of my copy describe <em>Good Omens</em> as &ldquo;funny&rdquo;, but I found the correct word to be &ldquo;clever&rdquo;. Both in wordplay and storyline, the writing is clever, witty, fast, and interesting. Weirdly, I tried watching the <em>Good Omens</em> TV series, and while much of the dialog is 1-for-1 copied from the book, it absolutely falls flat when acted out in person. I posit that books and movies are so fundamentally different that our brains perceive &ldquo;natural&rdquo; as completely different for each one.</p>
<p><em>Good Omens</em> is a fast and exciting read because the least probable thing is frequently the one that happens.</p>
<p>For all the trouble he tries to cause, Crowley bemoans that he can do very little to make humans more miserable than they manage to make themselves. This struck me as incredibly unfortunate. In a surprise clarity of cross-domain synthesis, my study of stoicism fits perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We suffer more from imagination than reality.&rdquo; - Seneca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to be miserable, it should be because some great and powerful force has rent calamity into my life, not because <em>I&rsquo;m</em> causing my own problems. At that moment I vowed to always appreciate and find joy in my digital watch. [1] [2]</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Garmin Venu 2s; it&rsquo;s waterproof, measures steps, distance, heart rate, O2 saturation, and GPS tracks of hikes, and it makes me significantly anti-miserable!</p>
