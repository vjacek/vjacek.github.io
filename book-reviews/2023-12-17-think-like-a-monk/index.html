  <p>Jay Shetty</p>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>This book took me probably 6 months to finish. I picked it up several times, but struggled to find it interesting enough to finish and frequently moved on to a new book. I would have greatly preferred to simply read stories about Shetty&rsquo;s time in the ashram, and how he applies those lessons to modern life.</p>
<p>It sits at the intersection of productive self-improvement and philosophy, so ostensibly a very interesting subject. Indeed, a few excellent points are made, and the similarity between India&rsquo;s Bhagavad Gita and Roman Stoicism is absolutely striking. The more philosophy I study, the more I come to believe that any personal reasoning system must be a reflection or view of Stocism.</p>
<p><em>Think Like a Monk</em> ends up being something I would recommend if you&rsquo;re looking for a first self-improvement or self-study book, but it does some silly things that make it a generally boring read once you&rsquo;ve been exposed to these ideas once. Each chapter has a &ldquo;Try This!&rdquo; section with overly simplified steps that make you feel like you&rsquo;re doing a gradeschool worksheet. Then there are silly graphics like &ldquo;magic quadrant&rdquo; charts and the like which duplicate what you&rsquo;ve just read, but in a quirky handwriting font to make it feel like a page directly from Shetty&rsquo;s notebook. This really fails to be interesting.</p>
<p>That said, I took away a few nuggets of golden wisdom:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be wary of the Ego&rsquo;s ability to make yourself think you know too much,. This is the easiest way to ignore good new input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not expect anyone to be good, or a role model in all ways. Learning a single lesson from someone can be plenty. It is then your task to assemble the positive characters you meet into the best possible version of yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
