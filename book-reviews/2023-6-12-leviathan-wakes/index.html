★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really figure out why this book was 600 pages long.  There&rsquo;s not a huge amount of action, intrigue, and certainly not suspense.  Oh, except that GRRM blurbed the cover and the proles think he&rsquo;s the only fiction author to ever exist, despite ample evidence that he&rsquo;s both a terrible and lazy writer.</p>
<p>Characters and places are described directly, but in the wrong sort of way.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idealist.&rdquo; one will say to another, without the reader having seen proof of such previously.  I guess we&rsquo;re just supposed to believe whatever the latest character says out loud.</p>
<p>The most irksome part of Leviathan Wakes is how clearly the author learned one single fact about outer space, and then used it completely up when writing.  If I have to hear about a ship&rsquo;s acceleration in multiples of <code>g</code> again, I&rsquo;m going to accelerate the book through a defenestration zone at several multiples of <code>g</code>.  Furthermore, <code>g</code> simply isn&rsquo;t a good benchmark when dealing with space flight throughout the solar system.  9.81ms^2 only happens to be exactly <code>1g</code> on Earth!  The martians don&rsquo;t care to measure anything in <code>g</code>, and people born out past the asteroid belt certainly have no frame of reference why <code>1g</code> is <code>1g</code>.  You can&rsquo;t keep telling us how tall the Asteroid &ldquo;Belters&rdquo; are because they grew up in low gravity, and also expect them to care about the value of <code>1g</code>!  Their <code>1g</code> is completely different.  This is just basic General Relativity.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t use common phrases like &ldquo;worth your weight in gold&rdquo; when humanity has been multi-planetary for several generations.  The correct phrase would become &ldquo;worth your <em>mass</em> in gold&rdquo; so that it correctly applies across the solar system and not just on Earth, a place most people have never been anymore.  I guess you could say &ldquo;worth your weight in gold at 1g&rdquo; since that&rsquo;s our only outer space factoid.</p>
<p>The book is also needlessly vulgar.  I don&rsquo;t mind when vulgarity is somehow <em>useful</em>, (although I contend that this is rare) or conveys extreme emotion, but here&rsquo;s an example of when it certainly isn&rsquo;t.  When talking about a communications array of collimated lasers, the array is said to be able to light up your asshole from across the solar system.  I get that the author is trying to describe a fairly small beam angle, but aren&rsquo;t there several more interesting and relevant things about the same size?  The sensors on the warhead of a nuclear torpedo of your starfighter, the captain&rsquo;s uniform insignia that you just unexpectedly inherited, or even an eyeball, you know, the only organ that can actually sense light and would perceive a stimulus by being lit up by the comm array.</p>
<p>One more thing because I&rsquo;m on a roll of dunking on this book&rsquo;s lack of tech and scientific knowledge - Nobody can &ldquo;probably hack it&rdquo; for values of &ldquo;it&rdquo; which are multi-generationally-futuristic smartphones being accessed only through their standard touchscreen interface with no tools or external interference generators.</p>
<p>Blah.</p>
