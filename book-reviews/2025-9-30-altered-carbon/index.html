<p>DID NOT FINISH</p>
<p>This book is absolute trash masquerading as Sci Fi so that semi-literate yet horny frat bros can pretend they&rsquo;ve read a book once in their adult lives.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that the primary Sci Fi concept of having your conciousness digitized and &ldquo;resleeved&rdquo; into a new body when you die actually has some merit, or could in someone else&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>The final straw for me was when the protagonist uses a &ldquo;termite grenade&rdquo;. Yes, a grenade apparently made out of small bugs who enjoy eating wood. I can only assume the author meant &ldquo;thermite&rdquo;, such a lame incendiary choice that pumpkin spice lattes call it basic. First, that&rsquo;s just sloppy editing. Second, it&rsquo;s sloppy writing. Third, it&rsquo;s stupid writing because as anyone with a cool 10th-grade science teacher knows, thermite burns very nicely but does not explode. A thermite grenade would sit there and quietly melt itself into the ground while everyone watches. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uxsFglz2ig">how they weld train tracks together</a>. And those dudes barely even engaged their safety squints.</p>
<p>I only made it about a hundred pages into the book, but here are the other straws that burdoned my poor literary camel until it&rsquo;s unfortunate demise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are far too many references to proper nouns - both novel ones (in severe violation of my <a href="https://vjacek.github.io/book-reviews/2022-9-3-enders-game/">Invented Terms Limit</a>) and ones that we recognize as commonplace today but which would be <em>weird</em> if they surived many hundreds of years into the future of multiplanetary civilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Kodakristal&rdquo; is a pocket hologram. Ohh look at me I&rsquo;m so terribly clever. Shut up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>She was beautiful in a sun, sea, and sand sort of way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seaweed becomes &ldquo;belaweed&rdquo; for absolutely no reason. And that scene takes place on Earth, where we happen to know about the abundant plants pretty well instead of another world where exotic species would make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protagonist picks a fight with a drug dealer apparently just because he can? There&rsquo;s no plot reason for it besides proving how cool he is and how his advanced &ldquo;training&rdquo; that we never learn anything about makes him so superior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author goes on a very strange attack against Catholics early in the book that makes his own personal vendetta clear, although he neglects to explain it in any kind of way that might sway you to his argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like any teenager knows, trying too hard to be cool is the precise thing that can make you the most uncool. After the protagonist rents a car he goes &ldquo;Cruising along at 150mph&rdquo; and then &ldquo;I rolled the ground car along the street in low gear&rdquo;. What a badass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total waste of time. I&rsquo;ve literally enjoyed watching grass grow and paint dry significantly more than reading this book.</p>
