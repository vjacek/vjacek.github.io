  <p>William Gibson</p>
<p>★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>The only lucid page of this book is the last, where Gibson somehow pulls an amazing Asimov Twist from the wreckage of a great many useless characters, their useless locations, and nonexistent relationships. Of the 2 stars here, 1 of them is awarded to my own imagination for coming up with an amazing world that is sort of written about in the book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discernable purpose to any of the 4 completely separate and disjointed storylines, none of which have any sort of climax or resolution, just a bunch of things that happen. Goes on too long with no tightening of threads.</p>
<p>To give the most generous interpretation possible, that might be the entire point of the book - a nihilistic view that none of anything matters in light of the mega revelation on the last page.</p>
<p>There are some cool ideas in the book, but the book is hardly <em>about</em> them, or based around them. The idea of plugging into the Matrix, a cyberspace (another Gibson-invented word) that feels as real as real life. Driving a robot or mech - approaching commonplace today, but groundbreaking in the 80s. Metaphors or similies that don&rsquo;t compare but just <em>are</em>. And Gibson&rsquo;s signature skips-the-fist-half-of-the-sentence direct imperative descriptions.</p>
<p>Most of the writing was far too psychedelic to be able to start forming opinions of characters, but for a few fleeting moments of sobriety Mona Lisa became understandable in a very sad or pitiful way.</p>
<p>Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry on Gibson will tell you that he ran away to Cananda to do drugs; <em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em> tells you how many drugs he did. I think it was pretty much all of them. I&rsquo;ve read so much Gibson, but have found <em>Neuromancer</em> to be a singluar beacon of incredible literary insight in a sky the color of a TV tuned to a dead channel.</p>
