<p>Ender&rsquo;s Game does several sci-fi-book things correctly. The setup requires you to suspend disbelief, invented terms are used well, and the story continues after the climax to a satisfying result that is both an ending and a possible sequel setup.</p>
<p>A good sci-fi book asks the reader to suspend disbelief about some, possibly very important, statements given as facts. The story beginning with Ender as a six-year-old makes no sense whatever, especially when his voice and actions would be a better match for a mature 20-something. However, accepting this early start allows for an important payoff at the end of the book when Ender still needs to see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes. Realizing the trick that was played on Ender a few pages before he did was immensely satisfying and made those next pages absolutely fly by. It is curious however, that even with all his brilliance, Ender himself does not realize until the game is over.</p>
<p>A good Sci-Fi book introduces a number of words without explanation that are used to enhance the world. Toon. Deck. Nullo. Each of these is used to great effect, without ever being explicitly defined. My theory is that there is a certain number of new terms we can accept within the size of an average book, and that exceeding this number will make the whole book and it&rsquo;s world feel contrived and destroy immersion. About 10 or less invented terms seem to have the greatest positive effect.</p>
<p>There seems to be a habit of writers or pattern of many books where the story is finished, the climax is unravelled, and the twist springs all in the last page or two, resulting in a sharp and sudden ending. Sometimes this works well, as in <em>Prince of the Blood</em>, where the twist works so well only because it is so abrupt. Most times though, I think stories can benefit from a more complete resolution that allows the reader to take a deep breath and wind down their view of the story as the characters they have invested in are shown beyond the final battle. <em>An</em> ending to the <em>Wheel of Time</em> also gives a few more breaths to at least the main character after the Last Battle, which is absolutely needed in a story of that magnitude. More recently, though I disagree with what happens in the post-finale scene, <em>The Peripheral</em> also dedicates two fast chapters to a victory lap for the characters and the reader.</p>
