  <p>Brandon Sanderson</p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p>
<p>The first book I finished in 2025 has a real chance of being the best book I read in 2025. <em>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</em> is simply a masterclass in writing characters that grow, demonstrate emotion, and have wonderful interpersonal connections. Both Yumi and the Nightmare Painter grow because they push each other, but also pull each other up when they need help. This doubles as some mental health therapy if the reader is so inclined to apply a lesson or two to themselves.</p>
<p>This book also broke a lot of rules, while demonstrating how some others should be followed. In one scene more than halfway through the book, they take advantage of something that has been normalized throughout the beginning of the story. This advances a newly developed plan, but in a way that feels completely natural. At another point, Yumi is a ghost which should make it easy to spy on their enemies, but because her character is timid and afraid of breaking the rules, has to be coached into action. This invented disadvantage or difficult actually makes the story better because it builds her character along the way, and creates an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>On the side of broken rules, the book constantly breaks the 4th wall in order to talk directly to the reader, something that makes the book both casual and fun. Another benefit of this is the ability to quickly explain, or refuse to explain, deeper complexities. In once scene, Sanderson solves having to explain some complex detail by using a character&rsquo;s snarky attitude to say that we&rsquo;ll be skipping over it - and that works, because it&rsquo;s actually in-character for them.</p>
<p>We want to hear about the stories of growth and struggle for success, not those who overcome adversity easily.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably what counts for smut in Mormon Utah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, Yumi folded her arms - rumpling her tobok - and glared at the machine. Painter stopped beside her and said softly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad <em>just</em> because it&rsquo;s technology, Yumi. &ldquo;Conversely,&rdquo; she said, her eyes narrowed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not <em>good</em> just because it&rsquo;s technology. Disliking this machine doesn&rsquo;t have to mean I&rsquo;m against progress or the wonderful things of your world. I simply think that <em>this</em> machine in <em>this</em> situation is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
