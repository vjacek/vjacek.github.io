      <description>Ideas  Ignoring things is more powerful than reading everything Lots of stuff outside of control can never all be read Organizing useful output - write logs, but good logs Process / workflow first, details second I love throwing stuff away Engineer s analysis of how to fold socks Umbrellas are the worst Usefullness is the Prime Directive of Design Prime Directive: make the computers do the work How to do a good job without caring because caring too much is what causes burnout Google opinion rewards and surveys aren&amp;rsquo;t worth the phone notification and interruption The only way to kill old bad software is to write me things that are so easy and fast and good to use that people can&amp;rsquo;t help but use them Story about how people who use newer tools are better (you&amp;rsquo;re better if you have the latest iphone) Hybrid strategy always wins&amp;hellip; On prem and spikes to cloud are stronger than either and don&amp;rsquo;t waste idle resources&amp;hellip;.</description>
