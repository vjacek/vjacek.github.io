DID NOT FINISH, RECYCLED</p>
<p>This book successfully tricked me into trying it by using the word &ldquo;Spy&rdquo; in the title, but thouroughly failed at being readable shortly thereafter. The &ldquo;spy&rdquo; part of the book is glossed over rapidly, the protagonist attending CIA training and becoming an expert in thrilling skills such as firearms, encryption cyphers, and avoiding other agents, all in about 4 pages. The rest of the book dives deep into her feelings, especially surrounding a CIA-training-classmate whom she falls in love with instantly and for no reason. She then travels to Spain for spy work, where she falls in love with (of course) the most famouse Matador in the world, also for no reason. Until her first love from CIA training shows up in Spain unannounced. And that&rsquo;s when I realized this book is a romance and has nothing to do with spies or WWII.</p>
<p>Oh, she&rsquo;s also a super model, but more than anything wants to &ldquo;serve her country&rdquo; in WWII. Suureeee&hellip; How lame.</p>
<p>Supposedly this is a true story, but clearly chooses to focus on the most uninspiring parts of her life.</p>
<p>Another miserable habit this book had was using footnotes every page or two in order to give extra context that should have either been simply added to the main text, or just dropped altogether because it&rsquo;s irrelevent. The best part of this book is inspiring another rule for my own writing: No footnotes in novels, or better yet, ever [1].</p>
<ol>
<li>A rare footnote might be excusable in a nonfiction work, but in a fiction novel they are incredibly immersion breaking and annoying. See how stupid this is?</li>
