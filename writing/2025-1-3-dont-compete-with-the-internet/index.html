  <p>Everywhere we turn, we are flooded with content to consume - your phone buzzes with emails, texts, and notifications from every app you&rsquo;ve ever installed. All this content is created by armies owned by the dopamine overlords, and those armies are willing to go to battle for their likes, shares, and subscribers. Like anyone who finds themselves in power, their number 1 priority is always staying in power. For them, this is easier than ever, so long as they continue to appease the almighty algorithm. With their own armies of followers already in hand, they can create the most useless content imaginable and reap the reward of your watchtime.</p>
<p>This is who we compete against when we submit content to the small handful of ubiquitous social media platforms that are popular today. The algorithms will do as they are designed: give us just enough reward to continue &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; our own creations for free, while giving no real benefit to the person who allows the overlords to profit from the real creative work.</p>
<p>Therefore my invitation is to stop competing with the Internet for recognition and social standing, and instead compete with the person standing next to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a good photographer and have made people genuinely happy with the photos I created for them. But I&rsquo;ll never be in the top 10% of all photographers on the internet. I <em>am</em> probably in the top 1% of photographers in my suburban town. And sometimes I&rsquo;m the only photographer present and have no competetion at all. In real life, showing up matters.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about competing with and comparing myself to the other photographers in my town&rsquo;s top 1% is that those photographers are real people. They have styles and preferences, things they&rsquo;re good at, and parts of the job they hate. And more often than not they don&rsquo;t really want to compete either, but are willing to talk shop and discuss ideas, news, and share battle stories. Competetors become coworkers and you gain the ability to learn from each other and build community around shared interests. For any piece of advice I&rsquo;ve ever shared, I&rsquo;ve learned 10 more good ideas.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t compete with the Internet. Create with the person standing next to you.</p>
