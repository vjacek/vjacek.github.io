  <p>Why do we like overpacking for trips so much?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because the brain loves resets and new things - I think the brain actually loves <em>getting good</em> at new skills and environments much more than it enjoys <em>being good</em> at those same skills and in those same environments.  The brain is near infinitely flexible and that&rsquo;s its ultimate strength.</p>
<p>I just finished packing for a single weekend away.  I wanted to bring a journal and necessary fountain pen, writing prompt book, a new nonfiction book to read, handheld amateur radio, laptop, camera gear, and Nintendo Switch.  I stood over my already full bag thinking &ldquo;wow, this sure is a great time to pick back up all these activities that I love&rdquo;.  When in reality, I haven&rsquo;t touched any of those for weeks if not months at home.  So what&rsquo;s the immediate necessity of bringing all those toys for a weekend away when I haven&rsquo;t even prioritized using them where they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> need to be lugged around in a suitcase?</p>
<p>More importantly, how can I figure out a way to use all those cool things while I am at home and they are simply on a shelf or in a drawer?  I think there&rsquo;s something in here about Cal Newport&rsquo;s time-block planning.  While my work days are generally pretty close to ideal in terms of having large contiguous blocks of time to work on focused tasks, and I have a good management system for my work-day tasks, my after-work time seems woefully underutilized.  Maybe the solution is some inverse time-block planning, where I can lump &ldquo;work&rdquo; into the 8am-4pm segment of my day as a single block, then break down 4-11pm into discrete activities instead of lumping them all together into &ldquo;afternoon free time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to learn that &ldquo;afternoon free time&rdquo; is where both motivation and tasks go to die.  Unscheduled &ldquo;afternoon free time&rdquo; automatically takes the activity with the lowest energy expenditure and expands it to fill all the available time, resulting in a whole afternoon and night with nothing to show for it.  I hereby coin the term &ldquo;Inefficiency Maximalism&rdquo; for when the easiest task becomes the most performed and results in the least productivity; You&rsquo;re doing a super lot of something, but it&rsquo;s not useful.</p>
<p>As used in a sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dude you&rsquo;re InMaxing TikTok, let&rsquo;s go play lawn darts instead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now 75% complete with the weekend&rsquo;s travel plans, it seems appropriate to take stock of the items I&rsquo;ve actually used, and those that have only increased luggage weight and hassle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laptop: Used several times, for a total of several hours</li>
<li>Camera: Used for several hours on a walk at an Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary where I captured photos of a Bald Eagle and Great Blue Heron that I&rsquo;m moderately proud of.</li>
<li>Fiction Book: Read 3-4 pages</li>
<li>Nonfiction Book: Read 2 hours</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch: Never powered on</li>
<li>Clothes: Wore 50% of what I brought, even with a margin of spillage safety, this was more than needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I see the above lack of stuff getting used as generally a good thing.  It means that I&rsquo;ve spent more time engaging with the location that I&rsquo;ve travelled to than with the stuff that surrounds me on every ordinary day.  The improvement then, is obvious; don&rsquo;t bring the stuff in the first place.  Think through the time available and the other attractions of location, and bring only those things that will realistically be used in the time available.  Better yet, don&rsquo;t plan around stuff, don&rsquo;t bring the stuff, and go find adventures that you didn&rsquo;t even know existed.</p>
<p>Those adventures and new experiences will be the only parts of the trip that you remember.</p>
