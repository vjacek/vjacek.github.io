  <p>What if everything was a moonshot?</p>
<p>Nobody remembers anything small, so why do we bother? Small changes rarely have the desired impact, because we have compromised before ever starting the project. When we accept that doing &ldquo;just this part&rdquo; will be good enough, we are actively saying that we <em>can</em> indeed see the big picture, but don&rsquo;t believe that either it&rsquo;s possible or worthwhile to accomplish it. Given that it&rsquo;s not worthwhile to accomplish the big-picture ask, should we even be attempting the scaled-down version?</p>
<p>I say No.</p>
<p>At Wayfair, my team was responsible for moving the Experimentation Platform from an old tool which could only handle A/B tests, to the one we had just built and were continuing to improve (we added multi-armed-bandit tests with evolving explore-exploit algorithms). I was continually told that we couldn&rsquo;t just shut down the old system and force users to move to the new system. We would need to test the new system ad-infinitum, build consensus and trust, and win the hearts and minds of users into our new and better system before we could be allowed to deprecate the old. All these, and other ever more insignificant tasks kept us from the moonshot: users on the new system. Under the guise of being a team player, I fooled myself into accepting that those other tasks needed doing, and never pushed as hard as I should have for the moonshot. After my skip-level manager and direct manager both quit, I should have just done it. Seizing this agency is a major lesson for me.</p>
<p>Later on at Gamestop, my team was tasked with improving the technology for stores and store accessories. We did that and more, and saved the company literally millions of dollars. But it took a disastrous 2023 Q4 earnings report to really highlight how badly we had missed the moonshot opportunity. While we had saved the company a bunch of money on expenses, sales were down and the core business plan (sell physical video game disks and pop culture accessories in a retail store) had continued falling apart. The moonshot should have been transforming the company&rsquo;s core profit generation into something sustainable during the death of physical media.</p>
<p>My argument is that moonshots are the <em>only</em> worthwhile expenditure of resources, because they set you upon the right path. Every plan will evolve, and if you&rsquo;re on the moonshot path, you are always further ahead and with more data and opportunity when the world demands evolution.</p>
<p>Even failures of moonshots are incredible successes when measured against compromised projects.</p>
<p>Even in failure, answering &ldquo;What If?&rdquo; is more valuable than not trying.</p>
<p>What if Wayfair&rsquo;s Experimentation Platform rushed headlong into moving users to the new system and failed to meet deadlines or usage metrics? We would probably have still had a bunch of users who were very happy and telling their friends, even if they lost a little data or had to restart a test along the way. That&rsquo;s more than we actually accomplished.</p>
<p>What if Gamestop had pivoted to new markets but still fallen short on earnings? We would have new data on products that sell well or poorly, be able to optimize on them, and the confidence to try new ideas again while gaining a better understanding of what our customers are looking for. In reality, Gamestop still lost money on retail operations as a whole, without any of those learning experiences.</p>
<p>One of society&rsquo;s most overused adages has rightfully earned its place in overuse through truth.</p>
